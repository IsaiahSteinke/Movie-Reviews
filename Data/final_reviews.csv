tt7286456,10,"Every once in a while a movie comes, that truly makes an impact. Joaquin's performance and scenography in all it's brilliance. Grotesque, haunting and cringy. Hard to watch at times,... but so mesmerizing, you won't blink an eye watching it. Tragic, but with seriously funny moments. Emotional rollercoaster - sometimes, with multiple emotions popping-up at the same time.this is far from a typical action-riddled predictable super-hero movie - it's a proper psychological thriller/drama, with the single best character development I have ever seen.",Joker,2019-10-04,8.4,965618,2019
tt7286456,10,"This is a movie that only those who have felt alone and isolated can truly relate to it. You understand the motive and you feel sorry for the character. A lot of people will see this movie and think that it encourages violence. But truly, this movie should encourage each and every one of us to become a better person, treat everyone with respect and make each other feel like they belong in this world, instead of making them feel isolated.",Joker,2019-10-04,8.4,965618,2019
tt7286456,10,"Truly a masterpiece, The Best Hollywood film of 2019, one of the Best films of the decade... And truly the Best film to bring a comic book so chillingly and realistically to real ife.
Remarkable Direction, Cinematography, Music and the Acting.
Some people are surprised to find it DISTURBING and VIOLENT, but it's a necessity and message.
It's about society and reflects those underappreciated/unrecognized/bullied people, proving they can do something too.
The way it shows class difference, corruption and how rich and talented rule others around them is not exaggerated and that's what makes it different.
It's BELIEVABLE.
There could be multiple JOKERs living in our society that could shake those around them in much bitter way than the film shows making people uncomforting people.
Consider this a wake up call, a message, but first a film. A PERFECT film.",Joker,2019-10-04,8.4,965618,2019
tt7286456,10,"Joaquin Phoenix gives a tour de force performance, fearless and stunning in its emotional depth and physicality. It's impossible to talk about this without referencing Heath Ledger's Oscar-winning performance from The Dark Knight, widely considered the definitive live-action portrayal of the Joker, so let's talk about it. The fact is, everyone is going to be stunned by what Phoenix accomplishes, because it's what many thought impossible - a portrayal that matches and potentially exceeds that of The Dark Knight's Clown Prince of Crime",Joker,2019-10-04,8.4,965618,2019
tt7286456,10,"Most of the time movies are anticipated like this they end up falling short, way short. Joker is the first time I was more than happy with the hype. Please ignore the complaints of ""pernicious violence"" as they are embarrassing to say the least. We haven't seen a comic movie this real before. If we ever ""deserved"" a better class of criminal - Phillips and Phoenix have delivered. This is dark, Joker IS dark and you will fall in love with the villain as you should. The bad guys are always more romantic anyway.",Joker,2019-10-04,8.4,965618,2019
tt7286456,10,"Let me start off by saying if Joaquin Phoneix doesn't get his Oscar for this movie. Then the Oscars should be cancelled. Phoneix is amazing as you might've heard from every review ever! But Todd Phillips. Is at his best here. The story lines he takes and visuals are just breathtaking. The score!! Omg the Score! Every time that score came on, I felt very uncomfortable, like something horrible was about to happen. It was GREAT. The Inspirations from Taxi Driver and King of Comedy are there, and add so much for the movie. And I got to be honest. There are scenes that are very violent. And its disturbing. But I honestly expected it to be WAYYYY more violent from all the controversy going on. Overall this movie was GREAT. Come Oscar season, it needs to be nominated for Best Picture, ScreenPlay, Cinematography, Actor, Score and Director",Joker,2019-10-04,8.4,965618,2019
tt7286456,10,"I get why some people hate this . It's because of the political message and how some people think that you need get empathy for Arthur's madness. But come on that is not the point and it will never be. Enjoy this masterpiece because Joaquin Phoenix and Todd Phillips overdid themselves with this movie . The acting,music and cinematography are just amazing ! Please enjoy the movie without overthinking it.",Joker,2019-10-04,8.4,965618,2019
tt7286456,10,"I have seen Joker yesterday at Venice an early ill-fated screening. We had some trouble with audio that lead to a near-hour delay, but it definitely was worth it.Joker deserved to be presented at Venice Film Festival, an event that regards cinema as a form of art, because this film is far from a blockbuster or a mere entertainer movie, as most films in the genre are.It focuses on the psyche of the main character, as it slowly crumbles under the pressure of society. And thus, Joaquin Phoenix does a wonderful performance, earning almost surely a nomination at the oscars at least.
It's a take on the Joker that differs from Ledger's, but I'd say that both are equally as good. The main difference might be that Ledger's joker is a rational that acts insane, while Phoenix's is insane to the root.Despite being a movie about a superhero villain, Joker is much superior to most of the movies of the genre (I'd exclude the Dark Knight Trilogy only, but Joker is easily as good as Nolan's movies, or at least very close). It is a small-scaled film, with a distinct style and cinematography (that cannot but be appreciated) and a set of very cinephile references that however do not feel too forced or overly opressive. (most notable are the similarities to Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver' and his 'The King of Comedy', but also Chaplin's 'Modern Times' is somewhat referenced).I am eager to see more non-comedic efforts by Todd Phillips. This movie was so far probably the best of 2019 (at worst contested so far only by Dolor Y Gloria or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood), and that should be very convincing.",Joker,2019-10-04,8.4,965618,2019
tt7286456,10,"It's sad that Joaquin missed Oscar for 'The gladiator' as he was very compelling Villain. But I am quite confident he will win it for the 'Joker'. Damn what a movie !!! Keeps u on the toes all the time. Unpredictable storyline and really a deep interesting plot. Did I forget to mention acting ? Damn Do niro and Joaquin teach u what really is 5 star acting.
To enjoy this movie, get a wine in your hand, close the curtains, turn of ur cellphones and put do not disturb sign on ur door. Best Dark thriller suspense movie you will get to experience.",Joker,2019-10-04,8.4,965618,2019
tt7286456,10,"I have just watched the Joker in Venice and I will say if Joaquin doesn't get an Oscar this year then something is wrong with this world. This perfomance is just jaw-dropping, it glues you to the screen and doesn't let go till the end. Story is very good and has some interesting connections with Batman lore(especially one you can't guess from trailers). There are some scenes that are so tense ,well-acted and imaginative that push this movie to 10. Cinematography and direction are great, Todd has proven himself as a director. Robert is also good in his ""small"" role. Will definitely see it again as soon as it out in October.",Joker,2019-10-04,8.4,965618,2019
tt7286456,7,"There is no doubt that the movie was well thought of - from the plot to execution. I must praise Phoenix's superb acting. He managed to portray very believably the awkward social reject and also the crazy murderer that he became. I really think it's a role only few could do. It was also very interesting to watch how he deteriorated mentally and little by little gave up on trying to fit into society. Gotta hand it to the script writer - the plot was unpredictable.But...There wasn't anything too complex about Arthur's mental state. No deep psychological analysis, or a web of many deep factors that created a one of a kind psychotic maniac. Could it be that I was expecting too much? Very possible since I came with very high expectations after reading some reviews.
What doesn't have anything with expectations is that at the end he didn't remind much of the original Joker. He felt more like a simply society reject that went completely crazy and started killing people. Not that much different from many other serial killers or mass murderers. He didn't have the master mind that so much designated the Joker and made him different from a simple murderer.
Another thing is that there were long parts of the movie that felt very dull.
Also I found it hard to buy the reason behind the riots in the city and the role the Joker played in them. Even if taken into account that the poverty and anger was cooking for a long time in that society, it still feels somewhat absurd that killing three people in the subway made the joker so notorious.
In conclusion, I can identify with the character which gave me a lasting impression of the movie, and this movie could have been very great if it was a movie about how a person that's rejected by society turns slowly into a serial killer. But as a movie about the Joker I felt it was lacking. Lacking the things that made the Joker actually the Joker, and not just another crazy murderer.",Joker,2019-10-04,8.4,965618,2019
tt7286456,10,"This movie causes the audience to consider many topics on morality, particularly the poor choices made by the Joker. The Joker is more relatable in this movie than antagonists usually are. I think this gives a more realistic view of ""bad"" people, who are not usually 100% bad in all ways as society often judges. It is important to know when to sympathize with the Joker (towards the beginning of the movie), and when he needs to be identified as a threat (when he begins making certain bad choices). This movie is only suitable for adults who are willing to pick it apart and think critically about it. It isn't for light amusement. That substance is what makes it so good.If you aren't able to ponder underlying themes on your own, and you have to be handed all your thoughts to you, then this isn't the best movie for you.",Joker,2019-10-04,8.4,965618,2019

tt7286456,10,"The acting, cinematography, sound design, and the script itself is phenomenal. This movie is a triumph. Joaquin Pheonix deserves an Oscar win for this tbh.",Joker,2019-10-04,8.4,965618,2019
tt7286456,10,"Need I say more? Everything about this Movie is Masterful in every single way! Joker isn't just an awesome comic book movie, it's an awesome movie, period. It offers no easy answers to the unsettling questions it raises about a cruel society in decline. Joaquin Phoenix's fully committed performance and Todd Phillips' masterful albeit loose reinvention of the DC source material make Joker a film that should leave comic book fans and non-fans alike disturbed and moved in all the right ways.",Joker,2019-10-04,8.4,965618,2019
tt7286456,10,"I quit relying on critic reviews years ago... I noticed for this movie that the critics ratings were low but viewer ratings were high. That being said, what is the point of a critic when for this movie, they are oh so wrong.
I went and saw this tonite with my mom. I went in skeptical and w some what low expectations. I knew not to expect your typical super hero movie.
What we got was a masterpiece. I went in expecting sheer boredom and I was instead on the edge of my seat the whole time. Not action edge of your seat, it was a fear of what he may do or say next edge of your seat. To see this character evolve into what we all know as the #1 villain of Batman was beyond genius and Joaquin Phoenix is a true master at perfecting the art of consuming himself into this character. I may be all over the place with this but I don't care. This movie, the story, the acting, directing, effects, everyone brought their A game and JP definitely deserves a nod and win for this role. And no, there is no comparison here to Jack Nicholson or Heath Ledger. Each actor took on this character and different levels, different story points and different points in time, so any comparison would just not be feasible or fair to any of the actors as they embraced him and made him come to life in their own genius way!",Joker,2019-10-04,8.4,965618,2019

tt7286456,7,"I thought this film was good but I just don't get the hype personally. The acting was amazing and the film was good overall but I think 'masterpiece' and 'film of the year' are a bit overused throughout the reviews. In no way did I dislike this film, I thought it was really good, just overhyped. I feel as though a lot of the 10/10 reviews are purely based on the fact that it already has amazing reviews and so people want to carry the praise further and that it is about the joker. If this film was released and was about some random guy in the same situation, I don't think the reviews would be as high but maybe that's the point.",Joker,2019-10-04,8.4,965618,2019
tt7286456,9,"Joaquin Phoenix IS the joker. Phoenix gave a performance that felt like a mixture of Heath Ledger's joker, Jack Nicholson's joker, and Alex in A Clockwork Orange:Overall, this movie was a trip to say the least. Cinematography was very good, and the soundtrack set the perfect mood for the film for the most part. The acting and plot are what sold it though. Phoenix made me forget that the character was one I had seen before in other movies. His performance mixed with the overall feel and plot of the movie made me leave the theater feeling like I too had just taken a descent into madness.I've never been a very big fan of superhero movies so I was a little weary going into the movie, but this had absolutely nothing to do with anything superhero related other than the characters. I loved this movie and will definitely see it again. It was just what I hoped it would be.",Joker,2019-10-04,8.4,965618,2019
tt7286456,7,"Do not really understand all the tens here. Sure, a good movie, good acting, nice shooting. But the plot is not so intriguing. At times it is really long and somewhat boring. I needed to double-check the genre to see if this is a drama or what. Crime, drama, thriller it said. I would put it maybe 90% in the drama and rest in thriller.I miss more dialogue, more depth, more substance. The plot is really not more then a somewhat crazy person becoming a bit crazier. Sure there is an undertone in that it is society and the system and the mean character of people that is bringing him down and creating the evil beast which later wants to destroy everything. Absolutely, but I think it is not intriguing story and plot and dialogue enough to give this a ten.Worthy of watching, yes. But not amazing",Joker,2019-10-04,8.4,965618,2019
tt7286456,6,"I went into this film expecting an all-time classic based on the reviews I had read & what I ended up watching was just a decent film overall. Phoenix is outstanding...so he definitely did his part. But I feel like if you've seen the trailers you've seen the movie because the best way I can describe this film is it feels like a 2 hour version of the trailer. At 2 hours it's a relatively common runtime, but it felt a lot longer...which isn't good. I'd say this is much more of a rental than a theater movie. Kinda just....eh.",Joker,2019-10-04,8.4,965618,2019
tt7286456,7,"When I heard everyone saying that this is the film of the year and all the reviews flooding in with 10's, I was quite hyped and excited for this movie. When I walked out of the cinema, I felt hollow and empty.Before I continue writing, let me say this, This is NOT the film of the year nor is it a real masterpiece. The cinematography is excellent and the acting is incredible, that's just it. The side-characters are bland and overly dramatic. The plot heavily relies on plot-twists and the film is so harsh that it actually falls flat on it's face.Are there no good points though? Phoenix is phenomenal and the score is great. The cinematography is also incredible but the plot is not that great at all. It even has plot holes and scenes that left me empty.Film of the year? Nope.",Joker,2019-10-04,8.4,965618,2019
tt7286456,10,"This is just my opinion but I loved the Joker, the performances, cinematography, directing, style, all build a great story. And the acting from Phoenix was incredible, he done a great take for the iconic character, and wow does he commit, with loosing the weight for the role, to developing the laugh.",Joker,2019-10-04,8.4,965618,2019
tt7286456,NA,"The recurring themes of so many of the 10 star reviews here should tell you a lot about this movie and its audience. If you can't get through a movie review without tossing in one or more claims that ""THIS movie is so much better and smarter than YOUR superhero movie"" (or even basing your entire review around this premise), then I hate to break it to you, but kid, you're nowhere near as intelligent and grown up as you think you are. This ""my comic publisher is better than yours"" BS should have been left behind on your grade school playground, it has absolutely no relevance to the quality of this movie, and your opinion of this movie should be considered highly suspect if you're in this group.I gotta say, if this movie was also your idea of the most perfect film ever made, you really need to get out more. Look, I get it. If you live in a safe little box where all you watch are superhero movies and mainstream blockbusters then I understand how exposure to themes like this for the first time would seem new and exciting to you, and I think we can all agree that this is probably the best DC Comics related movie in the last decade or so (though that's not a high bar to meet) and of course Joaquin Phoenix is a very talented actor, but stop and take a step back and look at this thing.Joker does indeed present a theme that is of importance to our society, that of the neglect and demonizing of the mentally ill to a degree that sometimes creates monsters which everyone around them should have seen coming a mile away if they hadn't been too busy looking away to avoid feeling uncomfortable. Unfortunately, reminding us all of the fact that this situation still exists is all this movie really has to say. It dances around important subjects like ""HEY KIDS, CLASS INEQUALITY!"", but then never offers any actual insight into them, usually because it's too busy making forced Batman references or dropping cringey little edgy moments like the ""Don't smile"" sign scene which seem to have been designed solely to have something for Hot Topic to print a new t-shirt of. Between that and every single plot twist being telegraphed so very far in advance because a lot of us have seen all these exact same twists so very many times before, I just wasn't impressed.Perhaps if this had been an actual stand-alone movie of its own instead of being shackled by its completely unnecessary ties to the Batman universe it could have done something more interesting with its themes. Don't get me wrong, I don't have any problem with superhero movies, but it just feels so gratuitous here, as if someone came up with this idea, pitched it to an executive, and was told ""sounds great, but can you make it a Batman movie somehow?"", and I'm sorry, but I'm just not into a movie trying to tell me a half-hearted, yet dead-serious speech about mental illness in modern society while simultaneously constantly reminding me that it's technically a superhero movie because $$$",Joker,2019-10-04,8.4,965618,2019
tt7286456,5,"I know this is an unpopular opinion, but honestly this movie is overrated and boring. 2 hours felt like 3 and a half.I don't buy the whole thing where he is invited to the show. The meta ""standup"" he made was extremely dull and boring. Then gets allowed to broadcast for that long without being interrupted, also being transported in the most shitty police-car ever after that, it's just not believeable enough to me.He also acted the same when he was on meds aswell as off, so that part didn't make sense either. The police must also be really not catching this guy faster after the homocide.It has some good parts but they can be boiled down to maybe 5 minutes.
Is this a movie I would watch again? Probably not.",Joker,2019-10-04,8.4,965618,2019
tt4154796,10,"There is no way that I could describe my emotions for this movie. I'm totally speechless. I haven't laughed (even cried) this much in Marvel movie or even in any movie. I'm fully on my emotion, there are so many tears of joy and loss. Amazing story, the acting is outstanding, epic action, great CGI, the best storytelling ever told in a superhero movie, amazing performance. I love it more than 3000.Happiness, sadness, pure joy, excitement... I'm gonna miss this moment in my whole life because let's face it- it's been awhile movies can bring such a big enthusiasm like this.It is such an experience you'll gonna remember it forever. People are clapping, laughing, crying, full of a state emotion. It's 3 hours long but it went by like a finger snapping by Thanos, and now I'm thinking I'm actually in Quantum Realm because it felt like 5 seconds. Even though you know where the story is gonna bring you because it's still a 'superhero movie' but it left me speechless. It's not just a superhero movie, it's more than that.**SPOILER ALERT**Even some characters that you didn't like before, you will love them in this movie. Like Captain Marvel. I didn't like her before in her own movie but in Endgame they showed how powerful, how strong and how capable she really is. And now I kinda love her! But Marvel should really be careful of her line though, I didn't like some of her line like ""I'm the strongest"" and ""You didn't win because before you didn't have me"" duh. Also not gonna forget Hawkeye. To be honest, in Avengers I really didn't like Hawkeye because he's just a 'guy' with an arrow and just randomly showed up in any scene but actually he's character is so BADASS! Everything that we need, what we want is here.Also I don't get it why some people can not accept that Thor is fat or treat him like a joke. I mean, this movie might be trying to give us a message about no matter what 'shape' are you, you can be a hero and save the world. To be honest, I like what they did to Thor, that man is depressed and taking the most responsible after he missed the shot to kill Thanos in Infinity War. Even though he already did killed him but it's not gonna bring back his people of Asgard. Also he's God of Thunder for god sake, he could slap his stomach with thunder and got his abs back.I'm so happy too for Captain America. Finally he could do his dance with Peggy and I didn't expected that we could see the fight between Captain America with his own self. Also when Tony met his father really warm my heart, and we can see the 'real-life' Jarvis - I didn't expected that too.When the whole superhero arrived it is so EPIC! The whole person in theater are screaming and shocked. Gives me a goosebumps and still left me speechless!This movie is absolute perfection. The ending of this movie is we and the characters deserved. It gives a perfect balance for all these past 10 years. Epic and perfect ending, I was not disappointed at all. This movie was completely emotional and visually stunning. Now I get it why the Russo Brothers told us to do a Marvel Movie marathon before watching Endgame because this movie had everything to accomplish what left behind before all of this.Ready or not, whatever it takes.Go watch it for yourself.",Avengers: Endgame,2019-04-26,8.4,837220,2019
tt4154796,6,"I have to say, my first reaction walking out of the cinema was that it was great. Probably an 8/10. You know there's so much fan service in this movie and I particularly loved the ""I can do this all day"" CA line from one CA to another. It was almost Toy Story 2, enlightened Buzz to naive Buzz banter.I loved Clever Hulk, found Thor hilarious, though a bit annoying at times, and loved the references to past movies. Cap swinging Mjollnir around was beautiful.The deaths in this movie were also pretty surprising but I agree with some of the more balanced reviews in here that it was bizarre that so much time was spent on Hawkeye - does anyone really care about him? Not really.Killing off Black Widow was a surprising touch, but I, like many others, probably felt more of an emotional reaction to Banner's relationship with her and not Hawkeye (because no one actually cares about him). Renner, as an actor, just doesn't cut it much, unfortunately.The real problem with End Game, is the time travel. I don't know why any movie franchise would ever want to deal with time travel knowing how much grief it creates. Sure they try to explain everything with their hilarious conversation about movies, but in the end, there are just too many questions left at the end of the day, particularly when they already try to explain it through the Ancient One.The most glaring one of these is, if they change the past, they're changing another timeline, so how selfish is that? If Tony Stark snaps his fingers and kills Thanos, what happens to that original timeline? If he sent Thanos and everyone back, how does he magically know not to send Gamora back who is now stuck in 2023 - and so does that mean 2014 Quill never meets Gamora?!? What the hell? Essentially erasing the entire 2014 GOTG franchise in that universe. If Captain America goes back in time, he will inevitably change history in some way or another, so that is another timeline, right? So while everyone else's timeline is meant to stay the same in the present (as said by Stark) how does Cap end up sitting by the same lake as everyone else.There are also way too many questions about new timelines created - but perhaps that is intentional, such as the Loki TV show. But this is why I hate it when they bring time travel into any movie and just add stuff to it to make it wrap up nicely in their own universe.Also, don't get me started on how impossibly strong Thanos suddenly is without an infinity gauntlet? Even WITH the IG he couldn't stop Thor's Stormbringer, but now without the IG can easily defeat Thor with Stormbringer AND Mjollnir, Iron Man and Cap??? How convenient.I also think Marvel made a serious mistake creating Captain Marvel, how is she brought in as a convenient deus ex machina and yet doesn't really stick around to show off all her abilities, and she can't even defeat Thanos single handedly? Pfft. That was rich. She can barely prevent Thanos from snapping his fingers, yet in Infinity War, Cap was able to actually hold off his hand too? Bizarre parallels.So okay, sure, it was enjoyable to watch, but I just feel that there are too many plot inconsistencies creeping into End Game. There should have been better ways to get the infinity stones back, and I think someone stupid just thought time travel was the best way to do it,.",Avengers: Endgame,2019-04-26,8.4,837220,2019
tt4154796,10,"After Avengers Infinity War, we waited for the Avengers Endgame. We wondered how the story would go on, how our heroes would turn back, what would be the end of Thanos. Many theories related to this have been put forward. Avengers Endgame was undoubtedly the most anticipated film of recent years. Normally, the higher the expectation, the higher the probability of disappointment. But this is not the case for Endgame. Whatever you're expecting, you find much more in the film. This means that the biggest concern about the film has disappeared.On the other hand, another comparison comes up. Is Endgame more successful than Infinity War? We can comfortably say it Avengers Infinity War is just the beginning of the story. Endgame was the finale of the story. So we shouldn't think of these two films as two separate stories. There is only one story divided into two parts.Avengers Endgame is, above all, a great homage to the ten-year history of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story highlights the original Avengers team. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye are at the center of events. No character comes in front of them. Of course there are many characters that play an important role in the story outside the original Avengers team. Everyone's concern was that Captain Marvel, who was included in the Marvel world, overshadowed other heroes. We can say that this certainly did not happen. What is important in this struggle is not how strong you are, but how good you are. This comes to the fore in all areas. It gives good message about being a hero and a family.Of course, Avengers Endgame has some critical aspects. For example, is the three-hour period necessary in terms of the story? It can be discussed. The head of the story moves much slower than the rest. It also drags the heroes into an emotional predicament. Then the tempo is rising and the heavy scenes we are watching are getting more meaningful. The last 45 minutes of the movie is fully action packed. But the last 45 minutes goes so fast that you don't even realize it. Action and battle scenes are really successful. There is not even a slight distress about visual effects. There are also slight logic errors in the film, but in general the story is so successful that these details become meaningless and insignificant after a certain point.Lastly, Avengers Endgame doesn't have a movie end scene. Because after the film's final, there is no need for another scene. The Marvel legend Stan Lee appears with a small stage. But this is the last surprise scene in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Moreover, there is no clue about Marvel's future. This makes us wonder more about Spider-Man: Far from Home. 10/10",Avengers: Endgame,2019-04-26,8.4,837220,2019

Which is why I'm not going to say anything about the movie. Not even my opinion. All I'm going to say is:The crowd applauded 3 times during the movie, and stood up to clap their hands after. This I have never witnessed in a Dutch cinema. Dutch crowds aren't usually passionate about this. I checked the row where I was sitting, and people were crying. After the movie, I was seeing people with smudged mascara. That's all I have to say about the movie.",Avengers: Endgame,2019-04-26,8.4,837220,2019
tt4154796,4,"I've just come from watching Endgame and I must say that I am disappointed.I loved Civil War and I loved Infinity War. When I came out of those films, I knew immediately that they were great and that I wanted to see them again. With Endgame, I'm not sure.I respect how they were prepared to show the consequences of what Thanos had done but by killing him off so quickly and then them having to do their own stone quest (hadn't we already seen Thanos doing this in IW) it felt slow and lazy. Worse still was that it felt very self-indulgent and attempting to be clever for clever sake.Like how Back to the Future II considered itself clever for showing the events of the first film but with Marty flitting around behind the scenes to ensure that it all still happened. I know it's meant to be fan pleasing but it really felt like a gimmick and lacking in confidence. Almost like it was saying 'Hey guys, this will make you smile'. If you want to make me smile, concentrate on maintaining the quality of your product rather than directly trying to make me like you.But the trouble with messing around with timelines and bouncing around is that it makes the audience start asking questions during the film. The linearity that we'd seen in IW and the imminent fast approaching threat is replaced in Endgame with a lack of direction and characters that are earlier versions of who the audience have seen.In IW we were shown Thanos. He was written to be sympathetic or at least a character that we the audience could understand. He believed in what he was doing and this made him more rounded. But in Endgame, that version is dispatched quickly and we are supplied with a 2014 (?) Thanos who isn't the character we know but is just a token bad guy.This Thanos hasn't made the sacrifice at Vormire, he isn't the guy that would empathise with Scarlet Witch for what she did to Vision. He has suddenly become a token cut out evil bad guy that needs to be defeated. Hell, the writers even manage to forget their own time loop by saying that this Thanos has learnt that he doesn't want to wipe out 50% anymore because they are too ungrateful. How does he know this when the 2014 Thanos has only just literally arrived in the post wipeout Universe? How has he had time to form the opinion that his previous quest for a 50% cull isn't worthy?Is this a case of the writers being terrified that they had created a bad guy that people related to or was it a fear that they'd written themselves into a hole? Why go to the effort of creating that character in IW to suddenly kill him off at the beginning of Endgame just for a dramatic punch?For me, the time travelling and stone gathering wasted time to create unimportant scenes that fundamentally undermine the films that came before.
In my opinion it would have been better if they had shown the remaining Avengers preparing to do some Avenging and maintained the single minded linearity of IW of battling towards and reaching a post click Thanos and somehow reversing his work.The more I think of the film, the more plot holes and frustrations manifest themselves. Thor's drinking and man child antics might have been initially funny but one begins to realise that they are deliberately doing this to clip his wings. Likewise with Hulk, his primordial desire to smash and destroy has been removed to think it out and he has become an embarrassing shadow of his former self.The thing that is meant to be amazing about the MCU is the world building but inconsistencies have been appearing and there are so many in Endgame that it makes you question whether these two films are written by the same people.In IW, Thanos is a dangerous and credible threat because he has the infinity stones. He takes on half of the Avengers, Strange and some of the Guardians on Titan and smashes them and then takes on the other half on Wakanda and smashes them. Yet it is Stormbreaker (whose creation we have seen been hard earned by a motivated Thor) that has the power to take down Thanos even when he has a full complement of Infinity Stones.Yet we roll forward to Endgame and we have literally all the good guys together in one place, Cap with his shield, Tony fully powered up, Scarlet Witch p*ssed and vengeful, Capt Marvel who can seemingly do anything and Thor wielding both Mjolnir AND Stormbreaker and Thanos NOT in possession of the gauntlet, yet they can't defeat him.It's like the fights in IW were so amazing because the good guys were taking on an unbeatable foe yet here he is now seemingly defeatable by the 'rules' that the writers established . A good example of this would be in IW when Cap is the last man standing before Scarlet Witch and he grabs the gauntlet. You see the look of admiration/respect on Thanos' face that Cap is holding open the gauntlet before he punches him to the ground yet now that scene seems pointless.The writers for Endgame seem to have been driven to undo everything they did in IW. All the tension, all the sacrifice, all the development of Thanos discarded for well, I don't know what. It makes no sense.IW had two incredible scenes that used to choke me up. When Cap appears in the train station, the Avengers theme kicks in and Falcon and Widow take down the henchman in a wonderfully choreographed scene. In just that one scene it shows them coming to the rescue, it shows how intuitively they work together and it showcases their heroism.Likewise when Thor creates Stormbreaker and makes his entrance on Wakanda, I felt it for the journey that Thor has been on. He's had to contend with loss and defeat and humiliation and this is his redemption. Here is a character that has earned his game changing weapon and when he arrives and demands to face a character that everyone else is running away from, I want to punch the air.But in Endgame, that feels like it has to be corrupted. We can't have Thor being dominant, let's break him and make him a fool. We can't have Thanos being complicated and relatable, let's make him a cut out bad guy. We can't have Hulk being rage fuelled and smashing stuff up, let's make him more sensitive and talking stuff out. We can't have Cap being stoic and heroic, let's have him ridiculing one of his own iconic lines in a silly gimmicky fight with himself and commenting on his butt. We can't have a powerful female character that we're invested in look sexy AND be able to take down Thanos, let's give Scarlet Witch a small part but focus our attention on a female character that hasn't earnt our admiration or desire for revenge.To be honest, the 'rules of engagement' had been set so well in IW that when in Endgame Thanos massed his ranks against the Avengers and then ALL of the good guys showed up, I was almost expecting the camera to pull away and not show the fight given that it was so obviously going to be an easy win for the good guys.And as for the big fight scene, it did reek of what DC always manage to do which is just throw everything into an end battle and bludgeon you with CGI and pyrotechnics so that you aren't really sure what is going on.In the many fights in IW, you knew what was going on, you recognised the combatants, you understood the stakes and you identified the geography of the scene. In Endgame we got one big massive fight where everything was thrown in the pot and it was just assumed by the directors that we would be happy with all the flashing lights.
And I have to say that considering that Steve and Tony fell out so hard, and that Tony's criticism of Steve was so unfair, that I really had hoped for more than just a handshake, a muttering of 'no worries' and 'here's your shield'. These guys wrote and directed Civil War, they created the line 'we fell out hard' and hence I had hoped for something deeper and more touching than a handshake.Steve wrote Tony a letter telling him that when he needed him he'd be there but once again the Iron Man bias had to creep in and once again Tony was the victim and the ultimate hero.But I think my biggest problem is how the convenient time travelling undermines everything. When a franchise starts retrofitting stuff (like Fury's eye being from a space cat), it's then hard to consider the previous stories.Having 2014 Gamorra means that all the evolution that we saw her go through in GOTG 1 and 2 is wasted. Having Cap marry Peggy means the pain of his sacrifice, him seeing her in Winter Soldier when she is suffering from Alzheimer's, hell even his blossoming relationship with Sharon Carter is kinda irrelevant. Having seen Thor at last step away from his two weaker origin films into the entertainment of Ragnarok and the redemption in IW leaves us now with a bumbling buffoon.We know that what makes Captain America what he is, is the serum that makes him a super soldier. That he was transformed from a weakling to a superhuman. Sam Wilson is not a super soldier and he didn't take the serum. He is Falcon. Now maybe in the comics he becomes Cap but Bucky is a super soldier. Is the new Cap going to foil an evil plot and be defeated with a tazer or a knife to the chest? Consider the beatings that Steve has taken and the physical strength that he has shown we can recognise that Sam Wilson does not have that.I'm sorry to say but the Russo's have dropped the ball. Themselves and their writers have succumbed to their success and their desire to be engineers of political correctness and social change. I thought Endgame would be the high soaring end to this 10 year run of impressive movie entertainment but in the end the writers got carried away, the directors over reached and the studio sacrificed the integrity of their product for a chance to 'educate' us all. A real shame and a wasted opportunity.Infinity War is clearly the highlight of the last 10 years but even now I fear that repeated viewings will render it pointless considering how the makers decided to fundamentally damage it.",Avengers: Endgame,2019-04-26,8.4,837220,2019
tt4154796,NA,"This latest of the Avengers series is pretty predictable because it is so formulaic: a convoluted set of story strings that must come together at the end, gratuitous little interpersonal dramas, and lots and lots of explosions, fistfights, and a pseudo battle of Armageddon. Also, predictably, the final battle must invoke Deus ex machina to save the day.It's too bad that a lot of engaging actors and Marvel characters are wasted on such an insipid, uninspiring script.The God wannbe, Thanos, is a boring and not a terribly scary sci-fi villain. He looks like a World Wrestling Federation refugee who overdosed on steroids. And, the quest for the five magic stones that give power over the entire universe sounds like a gimmick straight out of an adolescent-level video game.The first 60 minute takes forever to ramp-up. And the viewer is lost without remembering the previous installment,""Infinity War."" After a padded full three hours of superhero antics - so many superheroes I can't keep them straight - the ending is dismally anticlimactic. Killing off Iron Man seems terribly misplaced.

I've seen low budget movies that had better grasp on the scientific, logical and visual aspect of time travel.The whole point of endgame is to resurrect the fallen avengers and other trillions of creatures across the galaxy, yet while doing it avengers end up losing irrevocably even more important members of the team, and the whole thing looks ill-conceived.A lot of time is spent on meaningless conversations, while the devastation Thanos caused across the galaxy is barely shown, negating the past and current sacrifices of avengers.I left Infinity War wanting to see how the story ends.

There's a bit more humor and self-awareness than a lot of those classic stories, but never to the degree that it takes away from the twists and the mysteries. And there are some good twists. In fact one of the biggest mysteries is revealed midway through the movie which actually led me to check the time thinking ""damn, are we near the end already?"" but nope, they were just taking the movie on a left turn to Albuquerque that I did not anticipate and changed the course of the whole thing. Johnson has constructed a great mystery in the spirit of the classics. The fun of it too is how many twists there are without it ever feeling overdone. In that way also you can predict a few twists, but not another, so have fun feeling smart and still feel surprised by the others.

tt8946378,8,"With the exception of my wife and daughter, and possibly my mother, Agatha Christie is the woman whom I love most on this planet. She truly was the most gifted and brilliant fiction writer who ever lived, and it rejoices me to see that her work still inspires other writers and filmmakers nowadays; more than forty years after she passed away. There are still many adaptations of her original work, but with ""Knives Out"", writer/director Rian Johnson attempts something entirely different. It's abundantly clear that Johnson was inspired by all of Christie's typical trademarks and hobby-horses, and he pays tribute to her most legendary characters and favorite settings, but the plot of ""Knives Out"" is entirely new and scripted directly for the screen. A good old-fashioned murder mystery/whodunit set in the enormous mansion of a wealthy family, full of eccentric people each of whom have dirty little secrets, convoluted plot twists, continuous red herrings that practically make it impossible to guess along, and a fabulous all-knowing but slightly odd sleuth slowly unravelling the clues.Daniel Craig is downright terrific as Benoit Blanc, a private detective with a bizarre accent and weird one-liners, hired by someone anonymous to dig deeper into the strange and sudden death of patriarch Harlan Thrombey. It looks like suicide, but literally every greedy member of Harlan's bloodline had a motive for killing and - also in delightful Agatha Christie tradition - the plot even thickens after the reading of the will. It would be a shame to reveal too much about the plot, but rest assured that is refreshing and inventive, compelling as well as humorous, complex but simultaneously light-headed and 200% entertaining. The cast is phenomenal. Craig clearly enjoyed depicting a heroic protagonist that is the complete opposite of his James Bond character, and the Thrombey family exclusively exists of great talents, including Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Toni Colette, Christopher Plummer and Don Johnson. ""Knives Out"" is perhaps slightly too long, but never tedious, and very well-directed by Rian Johnson (who honestly doesn't deserve all this hatred from disappointed ""Star Wars"" geeks)",Knives Out,2019-11-27,7.9,472338,2019

FOX watchers will hate it, which I can see as kind of fueling the negative reviews.What can also fuel the negative reviews. is all the positive hype about it. Too much enthusiasm from the critics can hurt a movie sometimes. Viewers go into the theater expecting too much.Things never live up to the hype and this one didn't live up to it for me.

Daneil Craig does his best Kevin Spacey as Frank Underwood impression. But beyond that, I found the cast woefully underused. Jamie Lee Curtis, Don Johnson etc. I expected Jamie Lee to play a major role but she seemed more like window dressing. She also, as the daughter, appeared to have no real motive for the murder. So the real crime here was her underuse. 1/2 of the members of the family had no motive mentioned. Then, when the ""murder"" was revealed at the half way point, it was clear Martha did not really do it and was being set up. Chris Evans conveniently shows up at the halfway point with lines, so the reveal, for the most part is painfuly obvious, or at least most of it. The give-aways were pretty obvious, like granny saying ""Random, you're back AGAIN"" or the comment on how the dogs barked only with certain people. The mention of the ""slayer"" law was very, very obvious. I understand this is a parody of the sleuth genre but shouldn't there be at least some surprises?Nor do I believe this is a ""commentary"" on our situation today. Yes, there was a dialogue thrown in on immigration but nothing new was covered here.That is not to say it is a bad film. Daniel Craig and the cast seemed to be having a ball.

Second half picked up but again there was no deep mystery of whodunit, nor the charm and period atmosphere of a Poirot episode (which I can watch over and over - thank you David Suchet and the other main actors). The lead actress was very attractive, but the vomiting was definitely disgusting to watch, as well as ridiculously unbelievable (I guess that was the funny part?). Some of the characters had been under the sunlamp too many times or smoked way too often and looked weather-beaten. Did not like the sucking on cigars constantly. The last part was more entertaining and finally there was the rapid-fire conclusion thank the Lord. Agree that Daniel Craig with that southern accent was just super annoying.

Unfortunately, contrary to what many claim, there is not much here that makes it particular different or modern, except some hipster dialogue and humor (including a lot of throwing up by a specific character) and some commentary on current social issues, like the immigrant crisis, and pointing fingers at the ultra-rich, which is ironic because the writer/director of this movie is by now a multimillionaire and one of the highest paid directors in Hollywood. The writing is full of supposedly smart dialogue and ideas. In reality there not much cleverness here, while it constantly feels like the movie is trying too hard, and comes across as very pretentious and smugish. Most of the humor falls completely flat, it is overlong (130 minutes), twists are not surprising and don't really make sense. Only bright spots, Daniel Craig's amusing performance and the very talented Ana de Armas. Other than that, a semi-entertaining, mediocre and ultimate forgettable film. A perfect example of an uninspired writer/director, with a complete lack of originality, who uses a boring overused premise and accomplishes nothing new or interesting in the least.Personally I don't know much about Star Wars as I don't really follow pop-corn franchises, so I don't know what's going on with this director and Star Wars. However, it is very puzzling seeing this mediocre film which basically takes place in a house, getting so much marketing hype and buzz, while Hollywood seems to be in love with this movie and its' director. Looking around the internet for reviews and ratings one would think this is a serious Oscar contender for multiple awards, while some people are calling it the best movie of the year and calling out trolls (?) etc. I'm confused.",Knives Out,2019-11-27,7.9,472338,2019
tt8946378,4,"Being a middle aged Englishman I've been brought up on a diet of murder mystery stories and in many respects I've been spoilt. When the stories have translated from book to screen the production value is almost always secondary to the good conjunct story. I was very excited, having read the reviews, that seemingly in the case of 'Knives Out' I would be getting a rare trinity of a good story, good actors and good production. It certainly has two of the three. Unfortunately this film thinks it's cleverer than it is. It's simply a story of a privileged family and their pettiness with a rather trivial murder mystery chucked in as a contrivance to get them all together. Rian Johnson attempts to display the worst nature of the privileged minority with all the subtlety of a man screaming 'I am woke' at the top of his lungs at anybody who'll listen. Unfortunately subtlety and nuance are what makes for a good mystery story, you need to pay attention so as not to miss anything.

tt8946378,7,"Firstly, this is a black comedy - don't expect any laughs until perhaps the closing scenes - unless of course it is at Daniel Craig's utterly awful US accent - thankfully he doesn't speak too often.It's quite good to see a murder-mystery that actually lays out the clues for you to link up yourself before actually taking you by the hand and explaining everything at the end. It's even better to see one that isn't predictable AFTER you've worked out did what when... yes, there's a number of threads that combine deliciously for the grand finale.Watch this one with a little patience - don't expect it to grab you in the first 45 mins but it's worth it for the second half.",Knives Out,2019-11-27,7.9,472338,2019
tt8946378,6,"I went into this film with high expectations to say the least. I had heard so many good things about it, so it was built up in my mind as this phenomenal murder mystery movie, but it fell short. Where do I begin? Daniel Craig has this southern accent that just does not come across as convincing, not annoying, but not convincing. The main character of the film, Marta, potrayed by Ana de Armas, has this very unbelievable physiological condition in which she vomits every time that she tells a lie. I mean, come on people. This vomiting 'tool' is used multiple times throughout the film to figure out the truth about some of the other characters in the story. Let's just say that she vomits excessively until the credits start to roll.Now, the part of this film that really upset me was the 'big reveal' at the end. It is revealed at the end that detective Benoit Blanc knew about the blood stain on Marta's shoe the whole time. The biggest issue with this reveal is why he didn't ask her about it. He would have known her involvment in the murder the whole time. Why didn't he get the blood spot on her shoe tested? That would have easily put her in the room with Harlan when he died.Overall, the movie was entertaining up until we are revealed what happened between Marta and Harlan. Once I found out how Harlan died, I started to lose interest. It basically lost the 'mystery' quality once that happened. The story went flat after that but then took off when new developments started to happen. The reason I give this movie a 6/10 is because I was able to figure out things about the story right away, which left me disappointed, and the blood spot made me question a majority of the movie. It wasn't a bad watch, but I don't think I will be watching it again.",Knives Out,2019-11-27,7.9,472338,2019

8/10🗡🚪💉💸""Rian Johnson successfully revives the ""whodunnit"" mystery subgenre with this perfectly cast fun time, even if it doesn't bring anything groundbreaking to the table.""Knives Out is the kind of ""whodunnit"" film that will never fail to entertain. As a progressive mystery, Knives Out is a very fashionable movie with it's grand ensemble of fresh and familiar faces. With some very snarky and slick writing, these characters are albeit memorable, most notably Daniel Craig's Detective Blanc and Chris Evan's Ransome, however, the film fails to make full use of the ensemble to the greatest extent. Of course that never takes away from what else Knives Out has to offer. The intensity of every moment that leaves you questioning the motive and action behind the titled crime scene is delivered with such glorious fashion, one could say Murder on the Orient Express had a beautiful baby, this being the result, showing Rian Johnson's strongholds. While the first two acts of the movie are quite strong and promising, the third act finds itself being a little rough around the edges but manages to find it's footing upon the conclusion; one for all and all for one.Verdict: Knives Out not only proves to us that Rian Johnson is a strong director with the right material, but also displays a fashionable reiteration of what the mystery genre can do to keep us guessing what is left in store for us to see in all the right ways.",Knives Out,2019-11-27,7.9,472338,2019
tt8946378,6,"Have to say I was a little disappointed by this, not because it isn't good. Arguably it is, but no doubt because so many rave reviews suggested this would be outstandingly good, which it isn't. So as with so many films your experience & enjoyment will depend on the expectations you bring with you.Overall I think nearly everyone will enjoy this, particularly those who are tired of the standard fair of superhero movies or bloated CGI. Having said that while this is a far more intelligent kind of movie than the comparisons it is not entirely atypical of Hollywood. One of the good things or bad things about the movie depending on your point of view is the unstated but clearly evident political commentary beneath, but not always beneath, the surface and while this might add to your enjoyment if you like your bourgeois country house mysteries subtly subverted it's difficult not to be aware throughout that the politics on show is likely to inform the solution to the movie, which without giving too much away it ultimately does.What is genuinely enjoyable is Daniel Craig's slightly preposterous turn as a southern detective with an laid on thick accent to match. The rest of the cast features some big names, but unfortunately as others have pointed out they don't always have that much to do. Jamie Lee Curtis and Toni Collette are pretty much wasted as arguably is Don Johnson.The Plot of course in any whodunnit is the biggest player of all, and while it's quite good, it isn't that good or that original. The key device upon which the solution depends is fairly basic and the solution may or may not be guessable (for the record I didn't work out who did it, but did work out the mechanism involved). If one compares this with mysteries that pose genuine conundrums and puzzlement Knives Out falls somewhat short. A part of the problem is that for much of the film it isn't clear how any crime could have taken place and for that reason one has to place trust in the story that a crime really has taken place. In the event we discover a crime did take place but given its virtual imperceptibility it never came across as in any way shocking or sinister.Perhaps the best aspect of the film, aside of Daniel Craig, was the fact that the Johnston achieves a quite nice balance between the comedy & the thriller aspects which actually makes this film a more pleasant experience than it might have been the case had it just been a straight up thriller. I'll probably be in the minority on this one but in that respect though I'd have to say I probably enjoyed Adam Sandler & Jennifer Aniston's Murder Mystery more than this, including with regard to the solution. Knives Out is the better film overall but not quite as good as it - or anyone else I'd venture - thinks it is. Still enjoyable though",Knives Out,2019-11-27,7.9,472338,2019
tt8946378,8,"Good story with a creative and effective delivery. Very well written screenplay with all loose ends tied up together and reasonable foreshadowing and morals that echoes throughout, but there weren't any striking moments even to the point of final reveal, possibly due to the addition of yet more details approaching the end in an attempt to create a (slightly) forced satisfying end. Unnecessary characters and scenes that serve little to no purpose in the story other than for comedic effect were present, which maybe one of the reasons why audience may have a sense of emptyness when leaving the theatre. Nonetheless, Knives Out remains a fresh form of storytelling that is trying to achieve and convey more than your ordinary murder mystery.",Knives Out,2019-11-27,7.9,472338,2019
tt8946378,8,"People say this is Rian Johnson's redemption? Yeah, he never needed any redeeming. But at least this movie is helping people to realize that he is a guy with talent, and prompting people to not only keep their eyes on him, but to also check out the films he made before The Last Jedi. Anyway, this was a wildly entertaining homage!There were several moments where this movie, dare I say, subverted my expectations.The cast is awesome!The acting is great! Especially from Ana de Armas, who had better get more work! And Daniel Craig! Let me tell you hearing Daniel Craig doing a southern American accent was very jarring at first. But I got used to it. And it helped with the tone of the movie!The tone and energy is a lot of fun!The dialogue is very well-written!Each character is distinct!The cinematography is great!The music helps with the tone and it's used at the right times!The comedy aspects were funny!There were subtle set-ups with payoffs that were very satisfying!And I love the title! It's fun!
There's some cheese but it's cheesy in the best way! Plus, since it's a homage the cheese doesn't hurt the movie.And there's a moment where Marta lies and doesn't puke. But I let it go pretty quickly.
It occurs to me that Rian Johnson excels at stories that are small in scale. Looper and Brick for example. Definitely one of my favorites of 2019. Go see it!",Knives Out,2019-11-27,7.9,472338,2019
tt8946378,5,"Others have mentioned the old house might have held some secrets (it didn't). Or that it might present a more structured ""Whodunit"" that leaves you guessing (it didn't). Or that the main character might offer a bit of verve, cleverness or pizazz, that might have livened up the whole affair (she doesn't, at all).I also take some issue with the director's choices in scene framing, especially in the beginning. There should have been more close-ups, and better initial intros for each character's little idiosyncrasies so we would could warm up to them. I simply don't care for how it was shot; it's terribly pedestrian. The fast, quick edits of the trailer are totally absent! There's something missing here. Todd Solondz, Tim Burton or the Cohen Brothers really could have drawn these characters out more and given the actors something real to work with.I thought it would sparkle with a bit more witty, dark humor. It wasn't quite as funny or snappy as I was expecting it to be. Instead, it settles on delivering more of a ""message"" about this girl, who does good, while the others do bad.There's also no need for Daniel Craig's poor Southern accent. He should have just done a British accent, it would have been fine and enjoyable, maybe given the film a bit more weight it seems it was shooting for, in the end, with its messaging.Additional viewings might reveal there's more to it, but I suspect such might reveal there's less.",Knives Out,2019-11-27,7.9,472338,2019
tt8946378,8,"It was very hard to say no to watching 'Knives Out' and it was one of my most anticipated films since it came out. It was due to being busy and personal problems that stopped me from seeing it sooner. A lot drew me in to watching it. Absolutely love murder mysteries and seeing a lot of comparisons to one of my favourite authors Agatha Christie and the starry cast were reasons enough for me to see it, as well as the great reviews.Found myself really enjoying, if not quite loving, 'Knives Out'. Can understand why it may not be for all, if one doesn't like seeing and hearing the truth much earlier on than they would expect, and it is easy to see the ridiculing for Daniel Craig's Southern accent (which is admittedly atrocious). Can totally understand its appeal and why it was so positively received though, because to me it was a well made, well acted and cleverly written film that shows that director Rian Johnson does have a great film in him. While not perfect or one of the best films ever made (though was not expecting 'The Godfather' or 'Casablanca' etc), it is a long way from being a 1/10 film, putting it down there with most of the films riffed on MST3K, films from SyFy and the Asylum, 'Home Alone 4', 'NeverEnding Story 3', 'Titanic: The Animated Movie' and the Baby Geniuses films is insulting. As far as 2019 goes, it is towards being one of the better films of that year if not one of the very best.'Knives Out' had potential to be even better than it was. If it didn't overdo or repeat too much the vomiting running gag and slowed the final solution down (a suitably complicated one that is explained a little too fast for my liking) it would have been a better film.Wouldn't have said no to the truth (well some of it was) being revealed later than it was, though even when it was placed when it was it was still in the final solution not at all what things initially seemed. The film is a little overlong as well.However, so much works here. 'Knives Out' looks great, full of atmospheric colour, beautiful locations (the interiors of the house are especially atmospheric), stylishly photographed and slickly edited. Nathan Johnson's score has menace and energy, without feeling overused or over-scored. Johnson directs expertly with a clear love for the genre being sent up.It is a cleverly scripted film too, shining especially in the smart and affectionate 70s murder mystery throwbacks and deliciously salty one liners and insults from Ransom. The story never felt dull to me and even when things seemed obvious too early some ingenious unexpected twists are brought in. Can totally see how Johnson was so influenced by Christie's writing, evidenced from as early on as the terrific opening sequence and with Christopher Plummer's patriarch character (a type of character seen frequently in Christie's books). A fine example of how to bring freshness to a very familiar genre often visited, while the final solution is incredibly clever though demands full attention.Moreover, the ensemble cast, one of the best from that year, clearly have a ball. There is some delicious deadpan but also some inspired but not overdone scenery-chewing. Accent aside, Craig does a great job breaking away from his Bond image and revels being comedic in a laconic way. Plummer (RIP) is perfectly cast and while his screen time is not large he makes the absolute most of it. Ana De Armas has one of the most difficult roles and shows no signs of being taxed. Jamie Lee Curtis, Toni Collette, Don Johnson and Michael Shannon all give it everything they've got. My favourite performance came from Evans, also breaking away from typecasting, he was never this witty or salty.Overall, very, very good. 8/10",Knives Out,2019-11-27,7.9,472338,2019

I've never even seen the film people are so angry about, so my review is based purely on my experience of watching this film, Knives Out.I definitely expected more. If it's meant to be amusing, it pretty much failed on that score. This film would be better suited as a TV movie, if they even make them anymore, or something to pop up on Netflix. I didn't pay to see it and I'd feel I'd wasted my money if I had.Visually it was enjoyable-I mean the location, the house, the production values. the family members were an unattractive bunch, so nothing to look at there. Daniel Craig's ""southern"" accent became grating after awhile, and I was squirming a bit with boredom, waiting for it to be over. And, when it was, my reaction was ""So what? Who cares?"" I can hardly remember any of it and I just watched it in the last couple of hours.Convoluted, unrealistic and tedious, like a lot of Agatha Christie stories.

The story is fairly typical, there is a shocking death, everyone has their motives, and piece by piece the truth is pulled together by a sleuth, in this case Benoit Blanc (great name), who comes across as a more modern version of Hercule Poirot.To discuss the story, is to give away the twists and turns it takes, which are delightful. Tension is maintained really well throughout the film as you constantly try to guess and workout where this mystery is going, and even right at the end the twist that comes doesn't do anything to release that tension until literally the last 1min of the movie.The real joy though is in an all star A-list cast all performing at the top of their game, and working so well together.

tt2527338,4,"This movie introduced an absurd amount of inconsistencies, to the point where either they purposely reversed the whole point of the first 6 films to slap Lucas and his fans in the face, or they never watched any of the previous films at all. First I'll talk about what I liked.The acting, the visuals, the effects, the amount of lightsaber screen time, racial diversity, and obviously John Williams' score, were outstanding.Here's what I didn't like:* George Lucas confirmed that Palpatine had died long before Disney, the whole purpose of the first 6 films was that Anakin Skywalker was to grow up and defeat the sith to restore balance, which he did. And then this movie reversed that entirely* No introductory entrance scene from Palpatine, it's just thrown into the opening crawl that he's still alive....* Rey has healing powers? RIP Qui Gonn and literally everyone that has died in Star Wars up until now* Speaking of healing powers, that exact kind of power is what Anakin had spent most his adult life trying to acquire, everything he's done is to obtain more power and knowledge of the dark side, and then boom Rey just has it all of a sudden.... Anakin turned his back on everything he was taught in an effort to acquire healing powers. Rey is just walking around healing basilisks like it's nothing. So you don't need to turn to the dark side and kill billions of people? Light side jedis can heal all along? Anakin got pranked! Why didn't Yoda and Mace have healing powers or even know of its possibility?* The convenience of the whole dagger thing really took me out of the movie, wait whats that dagger thing? 3-PO pls translate. ""it contains the coordinates of the exact place we are searching for!"" hmmmmm that was real freaking convenient wasn't it, also why did the dagger exist? Why would Palpatine make it and write exact coordinates on it?* Apparently all it takes to defeat Palpatine is to have two lightsabers instead of one? You don't need years of training or wisdom...?... if only Yoda/Mace had known* The fact that Palpatine was able to conceive means he was able to feel love at some point in his life........ did he have a love interest raise the kids? did he raise them? Rey would have been more interesting if she was a ""nobody"", the fact that she's a Palpatine just seems forced and lazy* Rey and Kylo have had absolutely no romantic chemistry ever, their relationship is shown as sibling-like. The kiss was awkward, and totally random. But it's Disney, so is anyone really surprised by that?* There was no reason for Leia and Kylo to die, why couldn't Rey just use her healing powers to stop it from happening?* The back and forth of thinking people are dead and then boom all of a sudden they're not dead was exhausting. Chewey is dead! Nope. C3PO is dead! Nope. Kylo is dead! Nope. Rey is dead! Nope. They keep reviving each other until one of them couldn't anymore.* A lightsaber is a sacred weapon only to be used by jedis in self defense. It's not a flashlight, it's not something you lend to your friend, and there were 2 more scenes of throwing them off of cliffs, did they learn nothing from TLJ? In the movie Kylo and Rey both threw their lightsabers to get rid of them because they didn't want to keep fighting or killing...... so basically admitting they don't have self control? What kind of jedi are they? A lightsaber is not a killing weapon, it's for self defense!* The Rey v. Palpatine scene was so boring. Palpatine gets his full strength back, lightnings a whole fleet, and then is defeated in like 7 seconds... by his own lightning.... again* Kylo turns good? Of course he does. There weren't a lot of obvious signs of struggle, and honestly that would have been a much better movie if it was just from his perspective, I wanted more Kylo, but he hardly had screen time and had a disappointingly little amount of lines* Why bring back Han, Leia, and Luke just to kill them all off? Having the beloved three back together again is what was going to make the new trilogy so special, but they never got to reunite* The Knights of Ren sucked! Just kind of hung around and then got killed by Pajama-boy Ben all at once in only seconds of fighting* W. T. F. was that final Lando scene? ""Where do you come from? Lets find out""..... Ummm what exactly did you mean by that?* Palpatine has a new giant fleet? Why not just lightspeed something through all of them, because apparently you can do that now...* Episode 8: Leia sends out a signal to all the systems asking for help... literally no one shows up---Episode 9: Lando flies around to all the systems asking for help.... literally everyone shows up. Not an inconsistency I just thought it was humorous, haha!* What did Finn want to tell Rey? They ended the movie before they remembered to answer that. At this point JJ is probably just trolling us by leaving that unanswered* Kylo should have killed Palpatine, to at least be somewhat consistent with ""I will finish what you started""* Where was Anakin? Did he forget how to force ghost himself? Obviously didn't care enough about the resistance. Show us Hayden!* Luke's lightsaber just duct taped back together and it's as good as new?* A lot of this movie's purpose had to do with Rey's identity. ""Be who you are, Rey""... cut to the end of the movie... ""I'm Rey Skywalker."" Nope! you literally just learned that you're a Palpatine, nice try though* Leia should have died in TLJ... the unused footage was kind of creepy* It's pretty obvious that the trilogy wasn't planned out, there is no comprehensive storyline. What the trilogy is about is still a mystery to me* The pace of the first 30 minutes was super rapid, and then didn't stay consistent, they just kind of pasted scenes together but who cares, it's cool if you have a lightsaber out, right?* Poe can't catch a break for the 3rd movie in a row, just for comic relief too* In my opinion the best thing about the trilogy and especially ROS was the force connection that Rey and Kylo had, what they were able to do (communicate remotely, transfer objects to help each other, feel what the other is feeling, etc) was really interesting and I loved it. All of that ruined by the stupid meaningless kiss.Surely there will be people that love this movie, and I will never understand how they can look past all the above mentioned.

In the first one the force does not awaken. mostly because it is inconsistent with the force. It is always there and never sleeps. In the next one we do not have a last jedi or the series would have ended. And here all Skywalkers are dead. Rey trying to fit herself is laughable of course.,Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker,2019-12-20,6.6,381157,2019
tt2527338,2,"The good:
Cinematography
MusicThe bad:
No storyline. Palpatine came back somehow, was confronted by Rey and died again. It took her less than 2 minutes to finish him in the end all because dead Jedi suddenly decided to talk to her, comfort her she wasn't alone.The ugly:
Poe's speech before going into battle reminded me of every medieval movie I can remember. Then, 2 minutes later I saw a bunch of horses running across the deck of a Star Destroyer, freakin HORSES!Rey dies (why??) then Ben resurrects her (how??), they kiss (why??) and then he dies (vanishes), how&why??The RISE of Skywalker?? The 2 last remaining Skywalkers DIE!! There is NO Skywalker left.PLOT-BLACK-HOLESI remember downloading the storyline of all 9 chapters 16 years ago. The final trilogy was supposed to be about Leia & Han's kids, Luke's kids, a cloned version of Luke, a cloned version of Vader/Anakin and Luke eventually becoming the most powerful Jedi of all time after finally defeating the Sith in their ancient temple. The entire trilogy felt mystic, dark and after reading all 9 chapters the final 3 were undoubtedly going to be a ""save the best for last"" scenario. I am so disappointed. Star Wars is dead.

tt2527338,2,"As someone who has loved star wars ever since I was 6 , this is genuinely disappointing. This whole trilogy is an insult to George Lucas.First of all let me get this out of the way. I do not in any way blame the actors for the disappointment of these films. They did their best with what they had.I simply don't understand how disney is able to produce absolutely amazing Star Wars projects like rogue one, clone wars season 7, and Mandalorian. Then give us disappointments like the sequels.Disney doesn't give characters the proper development they deserve.-Fin was absolutely useless, all he did was keep shouting ""REY!"" Disney set him up to be something bigger earlier. Fin had so much potential and they threw him away. Not to mention how stupid it was to make all storm trooper defects force sensitive.-Speaking of wasted characters, Hux. What another absolute waste. In Force awakens they made Hux look like this intimidating Hitler-like character who wanted total control and dominance in the galaxy. A formidable villain for the series. In TLJ and ROS he became a complete push over that everyone abused. Disappointing-Rey turning out to be Palpatine's granddaughter almost made me walk out of the theater. There was no hint or indication that Palpatine even had a son or daughter in the prequels that led to him have a granddaughter.-They shouldn't have brought Palpatine back at all. Snoke was a completely original intimidating powerful antagonist that would have made such a great villain in all movies. Not to mention a brilliant performance by Andy Serkis. All completely wasted in TLJ and ROS, turns out snoke is just a artificial cloned being created by Palpatine.-the lightsaber choreography was atrocious. In the prequels and the clone wars, it shows that the Jedi were elite agile warriors, basically superhuman. In the sequels it just looks like kids pretending to sword fight with sticksThe only 2 things that were redeemable about this movie was Kylo Ren and the visuals.Adam Driver carried this whole series with his performance of Kylo Ren.

tt6320628,8,"Review By Kamal KI have to say I didn't read the comics, however out of all the superhero films this one felt the most balanced. It has everything you could ask for in a superhero film such as real life struggles. They really make you feel the struggle Peter has trying to keep saving the world and enjoy his youth. Also they really nail the villian in both of these new Spiderman films. Mysterio is sooooo amazing It made me wish he could have been the new replacement for ironman but like most movies there is the twist. Even with the twist he is such a layered character. I also loved how it goes so well with endgame. It's like pairing a great wine with a great meal. It does great at giving what fans needed a breath and chance to mourn our fan favorites that didn't make it. The use of imagery in alot of scenes of a character lost really helps make spiderman and the audience aware of the shoes he is trying to fill and the shadow of it. But it also makes you realize he is only 16 to have all this responsibility is insane. The love scenes are awesome they suit a young first love awkwardness. Instead of Frenching they peck and look petrified which is perfect. Also I applaud Zendaya as MJ she is the right fit. She brings something new not over the top but just right for a independent and intelligent love interest who looks like she can hold her own. This is how the mcu gets things right not only is there a layered plot and great comic faithful characters but they also leaving hints to connect other films and do twists that make sense and we should have spotted but missed it so you want to go back and say oh wow they filled me happily. I just hope they keep this highschool grounded aspect for future Spiderman films it gives him more of a deep and relatable aspect. I mean noone wants to see the same spiderman story over and over again and please don't bring back green goblin again for a film. I mean the vulture wasn't as big of a villian as some are and look at how well done he was. Sometimes new and simple are best. I am just hopeful they can live up to the bar set for themselves with this new great entry. But if this is the future being set up for the MCU then I am excited to see what's to come. To summarize it's a must see movie. If you miss it in theaters you will regret it. It's great on the big screen. great plot, great characters, great twists, great dialogue........so amazing I can't stop thinking about it.",Spider-Man: Far from Home,2019-07-02,7.5,332877,2019
tt6320628,9,"Best Spider-man movie of this decade. Plot, humour, vfx, acting everything is top notch. Especially Jake Gyllenhall...usp of this movie. The event takes place after ENDGAME when everything was turning back to normal. No brainer...so sit back & enjoy.",Spider-Man: Far from Home,2019-07-02,7.5,332877,2019
tt6320628,9,"Spiderman Far from Home is a really great film. Watching this movie, I enjoyed how suspenseful, action-packed and interesting it was. The special effects were fantastic especially during certain scenes. Some scenes that display this can be found when Peter uses EDITH, when Mysterio uses Illusions against Peter and the major battle against the drones and of course when Spiderman uses his awesome abilities. Some other scenes where this evident include the time when Spiderman creates a new suit from Stark's technology. It also gives a nice sequel to End Game. Plot twists and unusual surprising occurrences also play a big role in the movie as well. For example, when it is revealed that Mysterio is not who he says he is and the audience sees he is actually a bad guy working to exact vengeance. Instead of helping the world, he wants to destroy it and then get the credit for being a fake hero.
Watching this movie, I totally thought Mysterio was similar to Ironman and I was actually very surprised to find that he was not a hero, but a fake pretending to be a hero and look like an Avenger when he really is not. I definitely did not expect him to have a reason to exact vengeance on Tony Stark. I kind of feel bad for the fact that all Mysterio wanted was recognition and no body listened to him. The actions him and his team caused were brilliant but also so wrong on so many levels. His actions are not justified but I understand why he is angry.One scene with great special effects is when Peter uses EDITH as this shows advanced technology and gives a resounding answer to the question of Tony Stark's legacy. Tony Stark has passed down his legacy to Spiderman giving Peter access to Tony's satellite strike drones. He also has access to Tony Stark's suit design technology. It was really cool to see Peter designing his suit similar to the way Tony Stark designed his Iron man suit. Him and Tony share some similarities like the fact that they are both intelligent and good at math and science are able to apply this logic to their suits. Peter also shows his knowledge of certain topics that most sixteen-year-old young men do not really know yet. For example, Peter knows a lot about making a suit which is not a common skill.
Another scene which has phenomenal special effects is when Peter is on the inside of the huge illusion in London. He has penetrated the illusion and is watching how the drones are able to create this massive image. The really interesting part of the movie at the end, is that there is a possibility that Mysterio also known as Peter's worst enemy at the moment, can still be alive. At the end of the movie, Mysterio supposedly said his final words to Peter and died. When Peter asked EDITH if it was real, EDITH could have responded that the illusions from Stark's drones were down. That did not mean team Mysterio's original drones were not functioning at that exact moment. Before Peter hands over EDITH, Team Mysterio is still creating damage with their own drones and using projected illusions. For example, the battles of the fake water, earth, and fire elementals. These active drones could be using an illusion so Peter believes Mysterio is dead. For confirmation, at the end of the movie, Team Mysterio gets a download and it is revealed there are still active drones. Mysterio may still be alive. This could play out for future Spiderman movies with Peter Parker.",Spider-Man: Far from Home,2019-07-02,7.5,332877,2019

Jake Gyllenhaal did a magnificent job playing Mysterio. The plot throughout the movie was amazing. I can say that I knew that Mysterio had to be evil but I didn't know that he was gonna trick Peter into giving him the glasses by using projectors to fake fight the Elementals. Also the way that Peter can overcome Mysterio's illusions at the end is so good. The end credit scenes leave me wanting more!!! I would definitely recommend this film.

Jimmy used to let the door of his bedroom open because he trusted Frank. Frank broke the trust and as a result he could never talk to his daughter again. This door represent the trust, and show that trust must never be broken. Trust is even more important than love because without trust there can be no real love.Great movie, great actors, congratulations Mr Scorsese.",The Irishman,2019-11-27,7.9,331211,2019
tt1302006,10,"When I love a movie as much as I loved The Irishman, I feel torn. On one hand, I want to review it and rave about it and try to convince others to see it. But then on the other hand, I realise that doing so could set expectations too high, which could then lead to some people getting disappointed (this happens a lot with horror movies that get hyped at film festivals and then rejected by disappointed wide audiences, like with The Witch, It Follows, and Hereditary).So that leaves me in a tricky situation, and I'll compromise by praising the film as much as I can without overhyping, whilst also making vague comments that won't be specific enough to ruin what the film has to offer (because yes: it's a Scorsese film. He has an incredibly varied filmography when you break down just what he's made over the last half-century, and so you're never going to get exactly what you'd expect).Okay, acting: phenomenal. Besides Goodfellas, Pesci's best performance ever. This is the best De Niro's been since Cape Fear. This is the best Al Pacino has been in at least three decades. These men are old, and all accomplished and wealthy enough to retire happily at this point, but thankfully they all agreed to not only star in this movie, but commit themselves 100%. No one's phoning it in here. While the supporting cast are uniformly solid, these three steal the show and I hope all get Oscar nominations come awards season.Scorsese, to no one's surprise, directs brilliantly throughout, making every scene purposeful and captivating. The movie is long, but deservedly so. The various pay-offs towards the film's conclusion would not hit nearly as hard if the film didn't spend so long building character, suspense, and emotion.As crude as it might sound, this movie- at about the halfway point- made me forget how badly I needed to use the theatre's restroom. At a certain point, I accepted that I couldn't miss a second, and leaving the room for even a moment was totally out of the question.If you can see this at a cinema, and can handle three and a half hours without a toilet or snack break (no intermission!), then by all means, watch it on a big screen, because it's beautiful and ultimately the best way to experience a film of this scope and spectacle. But it'll be on Netflix soon, and perhaps some would prefer to watch it in the comfort of their own home, where snack/toilet breaks are possible.Whatever you do, make sure you ultimately watch it. Films like this don't come around too often, and this is such a perfect swan-song for this talented group that I doubt we'll see these legends together again.It's bittersweet, but if this is Scorsese's, De Niro's, Pacino's and Pesci's farewell to the crime genre, then it's an amazing note to go out on.",The Irishman,2019-11-27,7.9,331211,2019
tt1302006,8,"I don't know where to start on this one other than thanking Netflix for being the only distributor to fund this movie so we could see Big screen legends take their last big swing. The set and screen is smaller than I liked it to be, it being released on a streaming site but it's better than never seeing it.It's not a flawless movie and I wouldn't necessarily call it a masterpiece or something new and innovative. But for an old genre gangsta flick it's easily one of the best ones out there.The plot is a lot like Godfather 2 from De Niros perspective but that's all there is. It is more grounded and far too subtle compared to Goodfellas. And that's a good thing considering the age of the lead actors in the movie. But that doesn't mean its dull, gray and dreary because it isn't. It is surprisingly humorous, has some very serious scenes and doesn't shy away from giving us a blast of nostalgia every now and then.The cinematography is quite different from the usual modern movies we are accustomed to. It doesn't have an overabundance of Wes Anderson symmetric shots or Roger Deakins like Wide angle shots. The film was shot in a very old timey way with the camera pans and edits. The editing in the movie is great and the score is fitting. Technical aspects considered it isn't innovative or something jawdropping, but that was never supposed to be the main focus of the movie.The main focus for me was absolutely the acting. And why wouldn't it be with a cast like this? Al Pacino and Robert De Niro for the 1st time on screen together since Heat. Joe Pesci and De Niro since Goodfellas. Joe Pesci coming out of retirement and Martin Scorsese directing all these legends on screen together! If this doesn't get you excited for this film then I'm afraid nothing will.Speaking of acting my god do they act! Robert De Niro gives his best performance in his older age with this. Joaquin Phoenix was a top contender for best Actor Oscar and I agreed with that but after watching THE IRISHMAN everything changed. Robert De Niro basically steals his Oscar like a gangsta and gives the best performance of the year so far. Old Bobby here still giving top notch actors a run for their money and the guy is 76 years old!When was the last time you saw Al Pacino give a really good performance? Well that's exactly what he does here and it feels so good to see him find his glory days. He is his usual shouty self but shines better when he tones it down and let expressions speak.And boy have I missed Joe Pesci over the years and don't worry he's still intense as usual. And that's weird considering he is extremely toned down in this movie. If you're looking for a violent Joe Pesci like he was in Goodfellas you'll be disappointed. But if you're looking for an intimidating Pesci with a huge presence then you're in the right place.Harvey Keitel is in the movie for a very short time but he did his job fantastically. Ray Romano was a surprising standout and I can't believe how he kept up on the same plane as some of these industry legends. He doesn't really have a bigger role and basically gets lost as the film progresses but he made the most of his screentime.The film is 3hours and 30 minutes long but it never felt that long honestly. The first 2 hours went by a breeze but the 3rd hour was unapologetically slow. It felt a bit dragged on during the final hour and felt it was skipping ahead at the same time. it wasn't boring in any way but felt it could've been handled better. The CGI de-aging is so good that after a while you get confused how old the lead actors actually are. This is the best de-aging tech I've ever seen honestly.Despite it being slow in the latter end it still is a fantastic film. It doesn't set out to do something different, it doesn't try to set it aside from the herd. Scorsese did what he does best and made the movie he wanted to make. Its more of a last big hurrah for these living legends than something out to be a flawless masterpiece. It will most likely be the last of its kind and also the last collaboration of Scorsese with these acting legends. Considering the time we are in this might as well be the last Scorsese film, it most definitely is the last Joe Pesci appearance in a movie and the last good mobster hit with genre legends like Al Pacino and De Niro. So enjoy it while you can and savor it. Remember this movie 10 years from now and rejoice that you were alive to witness something truly fantastic. THE IRISHMAN is a farewell for most of these legends and a loveletter to the genre. It's the last of its kind and it went out in true mobster style.",The Irishman,2019-11-27,7.9,331211,2019
tt1302006,9,"I was able to attend the NYC premiere this afternoon. Now that I've gotten over the shock of seeing so many celebrities, I'm able to happily to say that this movie, while being quite long, deserves to be remembered as one of Scorsese's great films.The Irishman reminds me a bit of Tarantino's recent hit Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood, both because it's a period piece and also because you need to know a little history to understand the direction of the narrative. The movie, while following Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro) as the titular character, revolves around Teamsters union boss James Riddle Hoffa (played with intense and hilarious fervor by Al Pacino). Fortunately Frank goes to great lengths to narrate the story for the audience and provides a healthy dose of context for those of us not from the Kennedy era. The main thing you need to know going in is that Jimmy Hoffa had mob ties, and that he vanished in 1975 and was presumed murdered by mob bosses for being ""uncooperative"".The movie unfolds over four acts, told over several decades by Frank Sheeran. In act one, Frank is introduced as a WWII veteran who is stuck driving food delivery trucks in and around Philadelphia. He has the bright idea to steal some of the steaks that he's delivering, and sell them to local mobster Felix ""Skinny Razor"" DiTullio (Bobby Cannavale). Eventually his brazen willingness to break the law catches the eye of Italian mob boss Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci), who happens to be a mobster on a national level. His calm demeanor is both comical yet terrifying. A soon to be classic line encompasses Bufalino perfectly: ""You might be demonstrating a failure to show appreciation."" Under his mentorship, Frank becomes a ruthless action man for the italian mob and explains with rather entertaining dispassion how he does his job properly. In act two, Russell introduces Frank to Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino), the outspoken and fearless president of the National Teamsters Union. Their relationship grows and Hoffa becomes Frank's second mentor. Together they use intimidation and bribery to gain influence until the election of John Kennedy, who subsequently appoints his brother Bobby Kennedy as Attorney General and immediately goes after Hoffa.The first two and a half hours are the most fun, and in particular the end of act three is some of the most tense and dramatic storytelling that I have had the pleasure of seeing in recent memory. At a dinner celebration for Frank (who eventually becomes a Teamster boss himself), tensions between Hoffa, Bufalino and the other mobsters reaches a breaking point, and the decision is made to make Hoffa disappear. But in a gut wrenching twist, Frank is the one tasked to do the job. In a beautiful display of cinematography over a thirty-minute buildup, Scorsese forces the viewer to the edge of their seats with the dread of what's about to happen. Robert De Niro's performance in these moments is master class; the inner conflict is all the more apparent thanks all of the time we spent watching Frank being raised by Bufalino and Hoffa in equal measure. I plan to watch this part of the film again, probably with a notepad.Getting away from the plot a bit, the movie is actually surprisingly funny. In one particular scene, someone insults an older Bufalino at a dinner reception. He and Frank exchange glances, and the frame suddenly cuts to a hotel bed covered in guns. Frank then narrates with excess detail and hilarious dispassion the ideal weapon for a public assassination. Moments like these are littered throughout the film and keep it from getting too bogged down in it's violence. It's impressive how quickly jokes fly, given the disproportionate amount of people getting shot point blank in the head. But anyone who has seen Scorsese's Goodfellas or The Departed will feel right at home.The heart of the movie is definitely Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci. De Niro was de-aged with apparently exorbitantly priced CGI, as he is supposed to be younger than both Pacino and Pesci. While it's fairly obvious, I was never too distracted to not enjoy what was unfolding onscreen. Plus he's kind of made a career of holding one scowling facial expression, so that probably was a little easier to edit. Al Pacino is a riot as Hoffa, and is certainly one of the most arrogant, over-the-top characters that Pacino has played in awhile. Pesci as Bufalino is chilling, and it's fun to seem him as the boss in this gangster movie after being a junior-level mobster in Goodfellas so many years ago. The mentorship between De Niro's character and both Pacino and Pesci is amazingly entertaining.The only thing keeping me from calling this movie perfect is it's length. Three hours and (almost) thirty minutes is a very long time, and while occurring infrequently the movie does drag a bit. This is most apparent in the fourth act where Frank introspects during his final years, and attempts to achieve reconciliation for all the murders he's committed. It doesn't really offer any closure or seem necessary to wrapping up the narrative.Ultimately that doesn't even come close to making me not recommend seeing The Irishman. There's a reason Martin Scorsese will forever be known for his gangster movies. Combining comedy, violence, brotherhood and drama, he has created a formula that continues to work. The fact that he continues to make excellent movies at 76 years old blows my mind. Well done.",The Irishman,2019-11-27,7.9,331211,2019
tt1302006,5,"I love all the films of this genre-- Casino, Once Upon a Time in America, Goodfellas, Godfather, Mean Streets, Scarface, The Departed, Carlito's Way, Taxi Driver, etc. Scorsese makes some awesome epics, and I like a wide variety of other directors and their films in this vein. However, I find the hype and the hooplah around this one to fall a bit flat. I am sure I will receive some hate for this opinion, but this movie is nowhere near the level of Goodfellas or Scarface.1) The Run Time= I am fine with a 3.5 hour movie, but it needs to be great enough to fill that amount of time. I mean, at least 60-75% of it should be amazing. This movie is WAY TOO LONG for no reason. I can think of about 5 scenes that could be cut or condensed that did nothing to further the plot.2) The Aging and De-Aging of Actors= This was actually very distracting from the movie, and made me laugh in several scenes. Was this really NECESSARY? It seemed cheap and corny, and it really takes away from the movie instead of helping it. Wouldn't it be better to just get younger actors to play the really young scenes of DeNiro, Pesci, Pacino, etc??? No one is buying the age of these guys, even with CGI technology and effects. It ruined the belief of the moment.3) Pesci looked 139 years old throughout the movie, even in scenes where he is supposed to be young.4) Harvey Keitel's talent and presence was greatly wasted, as I barely remember anything that he did or said.5) The Women= the ladies are mentioned at the start of the film by name, and then become completely irrelevant to anything that goes on for 3 hours. They were extremely underdeveloped. This was one thing that complimented Goodfellas well- Ray Liotta's wife was always in the mix, or screwing something up, or threatening to kill him, etc.6) Lack of Suspense or Action= This movie became very run-of-the-mill boring after an hour or so. Nothing surprised me, nothing was exciting, and the action is so neutered and far between that I forgot I was watching a gangster flick. I can still remember Pesci stabbing a guy in the throat with a pen in Casino, or Scarface's last stand, or the beatings given out in Goodfellas. This movie barely had ANY MEMORABLE SCENES that stand out. The only great ones were a couple of really quick and realistic shootings of guys on the street or in an eatery by DeNiro.7) Pacino as Hoffa= He doesn't even resemble Hoffa at all, and neither do other people portraying certain characters. Robert Kennedy comes to mind as well.This is a decent movie, with great production values, classic actors, a legendary director, and nostalgic music with a great soundtrack. However, I just think a 8 or 9 rating is BS for this project. EVERYONE IS SIMPLY SAYING WHAT THEY ARE TOLD TO SAY, just like every other overhyped movie or author or artist. It is a good movie, but far from a masterpiece, or Scorsese's crowning achievement, despite what everyone says.Scarface, Goodfellas, Godfather, Departed= all light years beyond this movie, and with a shorter run time. This film needed to be tightened up and given some better scenes. It is interesting, but overbloated and overhyped due to the cast and director-- which can do no wrong in the minds of the average critic or average joe.",The Irishman,2019-11-27,7.9,331211,2019
tt1302006,NA,"You have to be absolutely out of your mind to legitimately think that this is Scorcese at his best and ignore all the flaws in this movie. Yes, I get it, he made a lot of great movies in his time, but this isn't one of them.A scene early on with Deniro beating someone up sums up the movie pretty well. The random no-name actor getting beat up is the only one exhibiting any emotion, as Deniro's character and his daughter sleepwalk their way through the scene like most of the cast does through most other scenes. It can be a bit hard to tell though since the camera zooms out so far that you can hardly see their faces, probably in an effort to avoid using the piss poor de-aging effects during an ""action"" scene, but it doesn't much matter because it's still close enough that we can see Deniro noticeably physically struggling to get through the scene. It looks awful and its depressing to see Deniro like this and to realize that Scorcese thought this scene was ok like this (why would they not have just used a stand-in here?), and this is pretty much how the movie feels in general.This is a very noticeably weak effort from Scorcese. Most of the characters are wooden and just seem bored to be there. Pesci and Deniro are shockingly lifeless here. Pacino seems to be the only one giving any effort, but even his performance only comes off like a pale imitation of his old self.Again, the de-aging effects are very weak and it's pretty jarring to see the flashback version of Deniro's character be referred to as if he's a young man (Pesci even calls him KID), but still looks like he's about 50.There are a ton of side characters introduced, most of which disappear immediately after their introductions and serve no real purpose. Likewise there are many vestigial scenes that serve no purpose to advance either plot or character.The plot is of course your typical gangster fare that we've seen from Scorcese so many times already. Guy gets into a life of crime, rises in the ranks, gets rich and lives it up, and then everything comes crashing down because he and everyone else he knows are absolutely terrible people, blah blah blah, we've seen it all before, but you know, you take something more recent of his like The Wolf of Wall Street and even though it uses that same old formula it still manages to be interesting because the characters have such personality and style and they keep your eyes glued to the conflict even though you already know exactly where it's going.Here? Not so much. The Irishman is an absolutely unremarkable mobster story with completely forgettable characters that don't seem at all interested in their roles and some production values and cinematography that the so-called king of cinema should be embarrassed to be associated with, and let me tell you, you people defending this weak excuse for a film aren't doing Scorcese or ""cinema"" any favors by blindly swallowing this crap and acting like it's the greatest thing you've ever seen. If you're so willing to suck down any product, no matter how bad, just because it has a big time famous name attached to it than you're really no better than the popcorn action movies and fans that you're so quick to condemn.As someone who's seen every Scorcese film before this, this is a 5/10 AT BEST and I will never pretend otherwise just because he did a lot of great films in the past.",The Irishman,2019-11-27,7.9,331211,2019
tt1302006,6,"Great acting, very good cinematography and we all know that Scorsese is a amazing director, but the movie is very long, and feels very long, a lot of great movies are very long and they are great, like Lawrence of Arabia and Schindler's List for example, they are classics and in my opinion The Irishman is not going to enter in this category.Also the de-aging CGI is not convincing, and why putting those contact lens in De Niro eyes, when Scorsese made The Aviator he didn't put contact lens on Dicaprio, in Casino, De Niro didn't look anything like the character he was playing, it was unnecessary, probably Netflix fault.The most positive point of the film was Joe Pesci performance, he is very contained but can also show that he is a very dangerous person, very different than the roles he played in others Scorsese's films, which are also great, and some other movies he starred during his career.Looks like we never going to have a great movie with De Niro and Pacino playing two real old guys with a lot of screen time together, and i'm not saying that a lot of screen time together is necessarily better, for example in Righteous Kill they also have a lot screen time, but that movie was bad, in Heat they have only one scene together, two if you counting their confront in the end, but that famous scene in Heat was extremely well written, acted and with perfect timing, but this is for another review.",The Irishman,2019-11-27,7.9,331211,2019
tt1302006,6,"Sadly a sub-par effort from one of my all time favorite directors. The story is weak (by Scorsese standard) and overly stretched. I can understand the appeal to revisit his trademark Italian gangster genre one more time, but this one feels unnecessary. The also trademark Scorsese humor is in-existent (except for the painting walls bit). De Niro looks disoriented, in the worst physical (hunched over almost the whole movie) and acting shape ever and out of place. Not very surprising, either. He spent the better part of the last 15 to 20 years doing mock impressions of himself which after the novelty faded ended him up in a series of quite dubious productions. That's a very long time to lower the bar and obviously takes its toll.The De-aging technique is unconvincing when the actors move. Their faces look animated, fake. There is little and uninspired music. Keitel looks fantastic but is underused. Pacino kinda overacts on occasion. Pesci looks fantastic and is in top form acting-wise but he's also in a supporting role (he's the best part of the movie) so he doesn't have a big impact on the movie. Romano is in top form but his part is also small.The movie is slow, linear, extremely long, predictable (how often have we seen the Hoffa story on screen? a superior version starring Nicholson comes to mind) and dull. There isn't much going on action-wise. A lot of innuendo and he said they said, but aside some quite dull hit-jobs where de Niro is supposed to be in his prime but moves like a 75 year old the story is quite static. The dialog is stale. Stunts are weak to say the least (Pacino's double excessively hiding his face when he hits the floor in a fight and obviously wearing a wig and body padding, and the store owner more than obviously throwing himself through the window of the store while De Niro clumsily mimics hitting him around come to mind, rendering those scenes borderline laughable). Colors, interiors, costumes are all in shades of beige. Camera work is rigid. Plus the Hoffa story is old news to begin with, there are so many insane things going on right now and would translate better to the screen in 2019. The edgy fast paced crazy energy of the more recent Wolf of Wall Street (not to mention his earlier masterpieces Casino, Raging Bull, Taxi Driver, Mean Streets or Goodfellas etc) seems that of a different director.All in all the weakest film in Scorsese's portfolio and not above a 6 stars out of 10 by any standard (I'm inclined to be lenient mainly because he managed to bring Pesci out of retirement for this. But by Scorsese standard it's well below that). It's more of a self-indulgent piece of nostalgia best left unmentioned when it's all said and done. And I'm hopeful that Marty will surprise us with more of his best work in the future and we can sweep this one under the rug.",The Irishman,2019-11-27,7.9,331211,2019
tt1302006,5,"If your one of those people thinking about getting Netflix just so you can see this dinosaur, please don't.
Watching Robert DeNero in this film is almost sad. He plays the part of a guy in his prime, but the CGI face doesn't work. It looks animated at times and his body moves like a very old man ... even for DeNero's age of mid 70's.
The grocery sceen where DeNero beats up the store owner is just embarrassing to watch.
Joe Pesci comes out of retirement for this one and shines. He has a stare that burns a hole through you.
Al Pacino as the flamboyant Jimmy Hoffa works well.
Harvey's Keitel in a small mob boss roll is solid too.
But the editing is not together ... the movis drags ... and the fellas in the film unfortunately are just too old to pull this off convincingly.
It's too bad this wasn't made 25 years ago, it would have probably worked.
Grossly overhyped epic that is passed its prime, in more than one way.

It Happened!

Quite simply, The Best Film of the Year!
No, of the Last 3 Years!
The hype is real, set your expectations as high as you can possibly reach!Let me tell you something, I'm 25 years old and I didn't really got the chance to live the era of Masterpieces, I didn't see Raging Bull/Goodfellas/Dog Day Afternoon at its time, I didn't experience how its like to watch the best actors of all time in their fully artistic command.
The first time I've watched Raging Bull I truly envied those people who lived in the 80s, I was always wishing if time can just go back and see De Niro's rage or hear Pacino's Attica once in a theater! But guess what, It happened!This is the end of the era! The summation of Scorsese/De Niro/Pesci/ Pacino career, a final statement by masters!
Robert De Niro is EXPLOSIVE!
Pacino/Pesci are unexpectedly MARVELOUS!
Zaillian's screenplay is on point, you can't go wrong with him.

It is a ""Too long didn't read"" kind of movie.
What is the reason of this enormous more-than-three-hours runtime? Probably to enjoy as much as possible Pesci, Pacino and De Niro working together.
But folks, this time has come and gone...
Goodfellas, Casino etc. and anything Scorcese did is amazing.
But getting mob-type genre back in play in 2020 needs a bit of a twist and taste for the different audiences. 3' 24"" is outrageously long and slow even for the fanatics.
I watched it on Netflix and it took 2 days to go through the movie.
Very slow character development, which is absolutely not necessary, as we as audiences are already trained in this genre.
If you don't like this mob-type genre and these actors, there is almost no chance you would watch this movie or you 'd drop it after half an hour.
Only plus is the good acting of course and the great directing but...if you are new to this genre, start from the classics!

tt1302006,6,"First off, let me set this straight that I'm not repeled by long or slow films. However, The Irishman is at the very least 30-40 minutes too long, and the suspense sometimes is killed off by characters dragging the scene too much. The biggest offender would be the second last arc which I'm not gonna spoil.Secondly, for such a slow film you'd expect the pay off to be worth it, but it isn't. The message of the film is revealed very early on, and it's very obvious where this particular plot line is going to. These 2 factors (slow pace and obvious plotline) make the film feels particularly unrewarding to me.Third is the lack of the 'wow' factor, which is disappointing for such a godlike cast and crew. There is not a single memorable scene or line that stands out for me, despite the actors all doing a phenomenal job. And no, I don't really mind the CGI, even though it's not the best thing since sliced bread. The music is not memorable either, even though it can be an artistic choice to make the film feels more grounded and unglamorous.So where does this leave us? Personally I don't think this is a bad film, but it feels disappointing with such a big roster. Don't expect this to be the film to watch with friends over, as it's pretty (unneccessarily) lengthy and the undertone is meant to be a heavy one.",The Irishman,2019-11-27,7.9,331211,2019
tt1302006,6,"Watching the wax museum version of De Niro for more than three hours wasn't the blast I hoped for. The CGI is not there yet. Dead eyes. Very distracting.Al Pacino pretty much tries to play Al Pacino, De Niro his usual bitter self, but nice to see wax-Pesci, who was the most believable character. He completely outshines wax-De Niro here.Oh, and by the way, Scorsese: there were no twin towers in the late 60's.I can rewatch 'Goodfellas' and 'Casino' over and over again.

tt1302006,6,"When we went to the start of the Irishman's career, I was honestly baffled a couple of times. What motivates this senior man to start stealing and hanging out with mobsters at his age? Is this young girl in his household his granddaughter? And they are now christening a newborn... his own?! De Niro was in mid-seventies so his character was at least 40 years younger! Makeup and visual effects can only do so much, he looks 55-60 in his ""youth"".It was a bizarre decision not to use a younger actor. Imagine Godfather II with 50 year old Marlon Brando playing his young self. That would be a smaller age difference. One of the most problematic scenes is when the Irishman's De Niro beats up a grocery store owner. He jogs stiffly instead of running and attacks the grocer with all the realism of a pro wrestling fight. I couldn't help but remember James Caan's savage street beating of Gianni Russo in Godfather I. Compared to that, this was pathetic.The movie is also unnecessarily long. You could cut an hour out and improve the pace. Too many slow scenes, discussions that don't advance the plot, driving around... For instance, there's a wedding of two characters we don't see elsewhere in the movie and we go to a slow motion study of the faces, dresses and so on. Why even show the wedding, let alone in slo-mo?On the positive side, the cast is all great actors and when they play their own age, they are perfect. It's a decent crime story but I don't see it becoming a classic, despite all the effort to make it 'epic'.",The Irishman,2019-11-27,7.9,331211,2019

Only Walken and Woods are missing.Making de niro young kind of works and isn't as distracting as I thought and Pacino is fantastic. If you expect Pesci to be the nutjob he was in the other Scorsese movies then think again and this is no bad thing. Pesci is one of the best actors alive with a fantastic range and this movie proves it.The Irishman is lovely to look at but for god sakes take a leak before you go or wait for its Netflix debut where you can watch it with whiskey and pause it for comfort breaks.",The Irishman,2019-11-27,7.9,331211,2019
tt1302006,2,"I cannot fathom two things: how this movie cost so much to produce, and why they wasted so much money doing so. This movie like watching a documentary about a political campaign that never ends. Seriously, save yourself 3 hours of the most boring and monotonous mash up ever. There is virtually no action or incentive to keep watching. It's 90% people talking at tables with lines like ""Who said that?! oh he said that?!"" or ""Ok, well you talk to him Frank!"" and then Frank talks to him, and then Frank talks to the other guys, and then Frank talks to him, and rinse and repeat. Occasionally a few seconds are spared for shooting someone in the head and then that's it. You are constantly left searching for a reason to keep watching, but it never comes.The acting is not even that good either. With the exception of De Niro and Joe Pesci, it seemed a little awkward. Al Pacino walks, talks and acts funny. They may have de-aged faces but the postures are very out of sync with their ages for almost all the actors. There was a scene where De Niro beats up a grocery guy that looked more like a rehearsal rather than an actual scene. I'm shocked they let it pass. I only laughed at one scene that had to do with ears and that's it (which is why I give this 2 stars instead of 1).I also gotta say that the ending was so anti-climactic and long-winded that after the movie I seriously sat there for a moment and contemplated why I wasted all this time on this hyped up monstrosity. Everyone claiming this is a masterpiece is either paid to say so or are saying so because of all the fancy names attached to this title. Or maybe they think they're being hip acting like this was worth a damn, I don't know.

The technology of that allowed the actors to be made younger was not impressive given the actors could not move as if they were younger. The one scene that made this point, was when De Niro's character roughs up a corner grocer for shoving his daughter. The scene is difficult to watch given De Niro seemed to struggle as much with his own lack of mobility to carry off the fight scene realistically despite having the willing and compliant younger actor. Al Pacino's character looked nothing like Hoffa. Yes the acting was good in general, but the story was just too drawn out and slow and the characters were just not that interesting to hold your attention. As a man of 58, the hardest fact is recognizing the increasing limitation as we age, this movie opens with De Niro's character in an assisted care facility. It is where this movie should have stayed.

tt1302006,2,"Is it just me, or is Robert DeNiro once again portraying the mindless and aging FBI honcho Robert Mueller from SNL fame in this lengthy biographical film????? He sure runs like a 76 year old man so why no stunt double for DeNiro?Pacino isn't playing Jimmy Hoffa. Every time he opens his loud mouth, Al Pacino is just playing himself. In fact a VERY OLD looking 79 year old over-the-hill version of Al Pacino. Sad. Terribly sad. Jimmy Hoffa is rolling over in his grave or he is breaking through 20 tons of concrete to stop a has been like Pacino ruin his reputation.Mrs. Shullivan and I were anticipating another long awaited Martin Scorsese 1960's-1970's period masterpiece crime film, but instead what we disappointedly sat through was an over-hyped, (too) lengthy quasi biography on just one of the many here say storylines on the 1975 sudden and mysterious disappearance of former union Teamster President Jimmy Hoffa.This film version of the missing Jimmy Hoffa focuses on three main characters, Hoffa played by Al Pacino, mob boss Russell Bufalino played by Joe Pesci, and the underling stuck in the middle of Hoffa and Bufalino, teamster labour leader Frank Sheeran, played by Robert DeNiro.THE GOOD:
Make no mistake, without actor Joe Pesci's strong but silent type mobster boss performance this film would have been most likely rated nothing more than a Grade B film with more than half of the finished product still sitting on the cutting room floor. Unlike the previous Scorsese directed mob films where Joe Pesci plays a raging out of control mobster maniac, in this biographical film Pesci plays a silent, very controlled, smart and resourceful mobster fixer who doesn't say much, but when he does, you better listen. I felt Pesci's strong performance and especially his one-on-one interactions with his underling Frank Sheeran kept the flame from going out on this otherwise forgettable and over rated film. Pesci played a similar role (crime boss) in the 1993 film, one of my all time favorite crime films, ""A Bronx Tale"", which also co-starred Robert DeNiro and Chazz Palminteri.THE BAD:
Why did Scorsese have the now 76 year old DeNiro and the now 79 year old Pacino play their respective characters Frank Sheeran (DeNiro) and Jimmy Hoffa (Pacino) from their early days in the 1960's through to the year Sheeran actually died of cancer in 2003? The film would have transitioned much better through the five (5) decades of this biographical story line if two different actors had played a younger version of Frank Sheeran and Jimmy Hoffa. Off the top of my head I could see Milo Ventimiglia playing the younger Frank Sheeran and Michael Chiklis playing the younger Jimmy Hoffa during the 1960's scenes and then transitioning to the (past their freshness date) Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino playing the much older versions of their characters.THE UGLY:
The film it's way too loooooong and boring. I understand that NetFlix has to fill in 24 hours per day for their millions of subscribers but to just fill in with extended and continuous chatty scenes that were just wasted minutes as were the smoke breaks alongside the highways and motels, ENOUGH ALREADY!Sadly, I rate it a dismal 2 out of 10. Badda Bing! Badda BUST!",The Irishman,2019-11-27,7.9,331211,2019

tt1302006,1,"The CGI faces create a soulless effect. It never feels like a real film, just a digital recreation where computerized characters are pretending to be DeNiro, Pacino and Pesci. They basically robbed us of the reunion by experimenting with a technique that fails so badly we know never to do that. The tragedy is this was not a time to experiment. They hang the entire picture on the believability of the de-aging, and it doesn't work for a second. It's egregious, bizarre, and will age horribly for the simple reason it's not registering as acting because computer programmers are doing the acting via mouseclicks. For Marty, a purest of cinema, to have this little respect for the purity of performance marks this as hypocrisy how he trashes blockbuster film. This is the theme park ride. This is a greatest hits tour through his oeuvre. This is uncanny directorial valley. I'm certain in 2050, you would get these old actors recreated exactly like this. That is our soulless future. Why rush to it? And the sad thing is, the cast were all there, and we will never get to see what they did. Clearly everyone is in denial and reviewing Scorsese's other works and pretending the emperor's wardrobe is just wonderful. When critics talk about the last half hour being a conscientious meditative coda on the gangster epic? Well sure, because they finally showed him acting. And it's not just that the CGI sinks the film, it's that it calls the entire thing into question and demands every other area perfect to make up for it, and can you honestly say the script and story is matching the perception of these rave reviews?",The Irishman,2019-11-27,7.9,331211,2019

tt1950186,10,"I was at the Philadelphia Film center premiere on 11/11/19 to view this terrific movie. At the age of 68 and a tifoso of Ferrari since age 8, ( 1959 ), this movie hit a nerve. Truth vs Fiction. This was a David vs Goliath movie, however Goliath wins. The movie recreates a golden era of auto Racing. It was seriously dangerous with death and injury a guarantee at every race. These drivers were absolute warriors and we're fearless. Now Ferrari winning LeMans six straight years in a row from 1960-1965 is actually the David in this movie. Ferrari for all their dominant winning form was still a tiny company that sold fancy $15,000 sportcars to support his racing team. Winning LeMans was a $16,500 team prize. These Ferrari drivers were salaried. The prototype class at that time was wide open with no upper limit on engine size. There was an under 2 liter class that Porsche and Ferrari dino control, but the over 2 liter was unlimited. I read carefully about the Ford move to acquire Ferrari, as daily news reports would cross the associated press. The movie is spot-on about Ford cars lacking desire back then. Chevrolet had the Corvette, Corvair and sporty looking Impala and Chevelle. Now Ford is the Goliath in this movie. They are the big corporate giant with unlimited resources. Ford paid for the Ford GT. It was really a Lola Gt with a Ford badge put on it. Ford put their name on every innovation provided by all the racing/equipment suppliers that went into that race car. Unlike Ferrari being designed, engineered and built handmade in that Italian factory. Ford spent more money on developing a racecar than the total price to buy Ferrari outright. Hired every Nascar team to provide expert pit crews, engine builders and offered 80,000-100,000 to each driver for one race . Now the movie, it's a movie that non race cars fans can and will enjoy. It shows how Shelby and Miles are really the heroes of the winning team. This was true. Their relationship is spot on in the movie and they know what is needed to win. They battle off the track against Ford executives and against Ferrari on the track. What is not disclosed in the movie is the quitting of the Ferrari ace driver John Surtees. When he left Ferrari, the team was devastated. He along with Ford's Ken Miles were two true warriors. Also not shown but lightly covered in the movie is the three years of disastrous outing for the Ford racing team. Did Shelby steal the Ferrari pits stop watches? Did Shelby actually throw spear lug nuts into the Ferrari pit lane to make the Ferrari pit crew think that the race car was missing a nut on the car out on the track? Did Enzo Ferrari actually tip his hat to honor Ken Miles? Who really knows. Everybody is dead. I remember the lug nut rumour in the 1960s, as that was a southern stock car trick. I never heard about the theft of Ferrari stop watches by Shelby. As far as Ferrari tipping his hat. Ferrari was known for or not attending many races. All that aside, did I as a Ferrari fan enjoy this movie. My answer is a Yes, Yes, Yes. With the exception of James Garner in Grand Prix, this is the best movie to deal with the sport of autoracing. Bonus is that it is also a great human interest story and they create the mood of the sixties as U vividly remember it. I rate this movie a ten and should be nominated for Oscars.",Ford v Ferrari,2019-11-15,8.1,301422,2019
tt1950186,8,"I've seen a lot of car movies, as a self-professed car nut. As such I judge them harshly, and immediately dismiss entries that don't provide enough reason to care about what is more important than the car: the driver. Think of the Fast and Furious and Transformers franchise. If you care about the driver, and the driver cares about the car, you care about the car. The car is a tool, an extension of the hero's body, and gains provenance with the audience when it helps the hero on their personal journey. Movies that come to mind that do this effectively include Gone in 60 Seconds, Bullitt, Need For Speed, The Italian Job, Batman Begins, and The Bourne Identity. Some of the James Bond movies do it well, like Goldfinger, The Spy Who Loves Me, The Living Daylights, and SkyFall, but many do not because of the lack of character arc in the story. We cannot forget about perhaps the greatest car movie of all time, Back to the Future. The shining example of how to make the car a proper star.And now enters a film by James Mangold and starring talented actors Matt Damon and Christian Bale called Ford v. Ferrari. My arms crossed, and expectations lowered, I was ready to be disappointed. Although I love Mangold as a director, somehow I assumed there would be a Michael Bay approach to the movie, putting more emphasis on car action sequences than the characters. To my surprise, not only was I dead wrong, but the film became one of the best car movies I had ever seen.Thinking back, I should have known better. Unlike many car action oriented movies, this one is based on a true story, and fact-based dramas tend to take themselves more seriously. It is sort of a shared biopic between legendary sports car designer Carroll Shelby and race car driver Ken Miles. The movie focuses on their efforts to beat Ferrari at Le Mans, a story I'm well aware of (like I said, bonafide car nut). And Mangold is an Oscar winning filmmaker collaborating with Oscar winning people such as Damon and Bale.And boy do their talents shine in this movie. The driving engine of the story, if you will, is the loving but at times clashing relationship between Shelby and Miles, portrayed brilliantly by Damon and Bale in a manner that in my opinion is more entertaining and engaging than the dynamic duo of DiCaprio and Pitt in Once Upon A Time ... in Hollywood. Damon and Bale have different styles of acting, but both arrive at the same place: creating a character that faces disappointment in the search for victory.Shelby has to come to terms with the disappointment of having to quit his racing career due to heart problems, and creating a winning team at Le Mans is his way of proving to himself he's still a winner. Miles is desperate not to disappoint himself because unlike Shelby, he's never had a shot at winning at a big race. This is due to his abrasive personality, despite an amazing talent on the race track. On top of this, Miles desperately doesn't want to disappoint his wife and son, who support him fervently in his dream. Both characters have their own obstacles in search of escaping disappointment, with Shelby dealing with the suits at Ford and Miles dealing with problems of the car in the race as they present themselves, and the trial of besting the other race car drivers. Their individual struggles intersect in the mutual desire to win at Le Mans, resulting in a brotherhood and mutual love for each other that feels genuine and earned.Henry Ford II, played by a very effective Tracy Letts, reveals in a quick but moving scene why he wants to win at Le Mans. After Shelby takes Ford on a whirlwind nauseating ride with the new race car they have engineered, Ford breaks into tears. Not so much because of the physically jarring experience of being jostled around at breakneck speed, but because of what the car means to his family name. ""I had no idea. If only my dad were alive to see this,"" he tells Shelby. Damon, in that scene, responds with wet eyes. The character Ford reveals how much he doesn't want to disappoint his family legacy. In fact, the entire endeavor started with an insult from Ferrari, stating, ""You're only Henry Ford the second, you'll never be Henry Ford."" And in an earlier scene, Ford compares himself to his legendary grandfather in a speech to Ford factory workers concerning his disappointment in current company sales.Cars represent man's desire to chase a dream. Whether it be designing the fastest car, or driving cars the fastest. And despite all the obstacles that may get in man's way, the biggest one is always himself. But with perseverance and the help of others, this obstacle can too be overcome. Ford v. Ferrari manages to get to the heart of this message with deceptive ease and supreme confidence. The film's absolutely gorgeous cinematography and direction capture some of the most amazing car sequences ever put to the big screen. A surprising but believable behind the scenes factoid is that Mangold and the cast are not car nuts at all, and were simply moved to tell the story of the characters. This is why the movie works so well, because they understood the car as supporting the story rather than the other way around.Ford v. Ferrari is an absolute winner, with memorable performances from its cast, and my favorite Mangold picture thus far. For me, it is one of the best of the year, and as far as car movies go, one of the best ever made, and miles away from a disappointment.",Ford v Ferrari,2019-11-15,8.1,301422,2019

I have zero interest in cars - and thus I know absolutely nothing of the history. I knew nothing of this film beyond reading the blurb before I started watching it, so I was very interested to see whether I would like it at all. I did. Despite being so uninterested in the subject, the film got me interested in the story, and especially during the final race I was on the edge of seat not knowing what would happen. Fantastic acting job from both Damon and Bale, usual. They never disappoint. Excellent writing, directing, cutting, sound editing..

The action scenes are shot to perfection and will have you biting your nails.The film's technical aspects were top-notch as well. Wait for this film to be nominated for sound design and editing. These technical aspects, during the climax of the film, will blow your hair back and give you goosebumps.All in all, this film provides a pleasing experience for the crowd that not many films can even come close to delivering.

tt1950186,9,"Biopics can be a hard sell at times. Whether you're diving into the troubled life of an addict or exploring someone's sexuality, there are many touchy subjects these days. With that said, I feel there are also those that will stand the test of time, in terms of being able to please a wide audience. Ford v Ferrari is one of the latest true stories out of Hollywood that will be hitting the big screen soon, and here's why I believe it absolutely deserves attention.Following multiple characters throughout, Ford v Ferrari focussed on the fact that Henry Ford II was given an idea to create the fastest race car in the world. His mission is to take down the likes of the company Ferrari, who have held the title for years. Carol Shelby (Matt Damon) is approached by a member of the Ford team and is recruited, only to be the one finding himself recruiting the driver in Ken Miles (Christian Bale). That's the core premise and there's a lot to dive into from there.If you're a fan of racing or cars in general, this movie will be for you. This is a very well-directed film by James Mangold, and the racing sequences are quite long, taking up a good chunk of the nearly 150-minute run time. Luckily, they are very intense, practically shot, with a fantastic score to back it up, and sound effects to get your heart pumping. Everything about the exciting aspects of this film was top notch.Christian Bale and Matt Damon give stellar performances here as the two leading men in the film and I totally bought their rigid friendship that slowly developed. Sadly, without giving anything away, there is an incident that I feel was not explored enough, which slightly took away when a certain moment is meant to impact the movie. Other than that, this is a fantastic movie from beginning to end.In the end, Ford v Ferrari is engaging, emotional, and downright thrilling when it wants to be. I was invested in these characters and on the edge of my seat during the climactic races. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience with this movie. There is a missed opportunity in terms of emotion during a certain scene, but I was able to forgive that, seeing as the rest of the movie was so impressive. Ford v Ferrari is one of the best movies I've seen so far this year and it will be one to see when it officially releases.",Ford v Ferrari,2019-11-15,8.1,301422,2019
tt1950186,9,"I've never watched a car race in my life. I have absolutely no knowledge of the historic events surrounding the Ford and Ferrari motor companies. None of those two things mattered in my viewing experience of ""Ford v Ferrari"". Not only does it allow the viewer to be a complete clean slate, but it provides the utmost of entertainment on almost every front.For a very basic overview, this movie tells the story of how the Ford Motor Company was struggling in the 1960s and thus turned to racing cars to give their image a boost. The problem? For years, Ferrari has been the gold standard in that theater. But with Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) overseeing the project and the volatile Ken Miles (Christian Bale) in the driver's seat, they set out to take down Ferrari at the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans race.One of the main strengths of ""Ford v Ferrari"" is that it tells a bunch of different stories within the basic framework. Not only is it the clash that the title anticipates, but also a story of personal redemption for Shelby, one of personal goal-achievement for Miles, and even a healthy dose of ""big corporation screwing over the little guy"" thrown in. All of those angles are very distinct, with nothing muddled along the way. The 2.5 hour runtime really helps with this, allowing such arcs to play out in their entirety.The acting is also incredible from basically the entire cast. Bale gives a unique, quirky performance as seemingly only he can, Damon is solid (as always), and everyone else does their part admirably. Especially affecting are Miles' wife Mollie (Caitriona Balfe) and son Peter (Noah Jupe), who both provide much of the sentimental emotions present in the film. A specific scene where Ken explains to Peter exactly what he does on each individual racing lap is as good as acting gets.There's also a never-ending sense of forward momentum and just overall fun to ""Ford v Ferrari"". It never takes itself too seriously, yet it isn't a comedy. It's long, but doesn't feel that way due to the expert pacing--a perfect balance of pulse-pounding action scenes and slower, more emotional scenes within the understated 1960s period feel. Director James Mangold probably deserves a good amount of the credit for making this all congeal together as well as it did.Overall, this is a spectacular film precisely because it can hit audiences in so many different ways. Whether through the action, emotion, true story, or underlying themes, most viewers will be able to find something to enjoy here.

tt6146586,4,"So this is the first review I've wrote. Anyway, I don't know where these people are coming from that call the movie exciting, non-stop, incredible, OMG, etc. To be clear, I loved the first John Wick. The second one to me was eh because it got really silly with the whole ""high table"" and medallions and basically everyone in the world is a contract killer, etc. John Wick 3 is basically the second one, only on PCP.The entire 3rd film is literally like watching someone play a video game with god mode on. Nothing stops him. He gets stabbed in the neck, that's ok. Stitch it up, move on. People fire hundreds of rounds at him. It's ok, they all missed. He gets hit with two cars literally back to back. He just gets up. Hell, he gets shot point blank 5/6 times and falls out of a 4th or 5th story balcony, bounces off of everything and splats on the street, it's ok, he's still alive and just ""angry"" now. The entire movie is just and endless line of contract killers coming up to Wick and them fighting.Don't get me wrong, I love action movies and like I said, I loved the first one. Without a good story though, it's just silly. After about 45/50 minutes, you literally start shaking your head because it just becomes really repetitive. A friend of mine asked me how the movie was afterward. It can be summed up as ""everyone goes after Wick, everyone dies, the end."" The movie is also left wide open for a sequel which just blew my mind. Just stop.

We don't know if Derek Kolstad had thought that John Wick would be this big when he first created it, but when we came to the third film it seems clear how the story deepened and became beautiful.This film offers you all kinds of action. The film has a unique style of action. Any action you can think of is included in the third film. Moreover, exponentially! The enemies are increasingly jumping. As we saw in the trailer, there is even a horse escape scene. There's so much more to it. At this point, sometimes there can be a small illusion in the viewer. Only action-oriented films can be considered empty. We can say that John Wick 3 offers almost uninterrupted action for 2 hours and 10 minutes. But in doing so, it doesn't forget the story. You will learn new and very interesting details of John Wick and you will get new ideas about the functioning of the universe.Stahelski has very impressive shots.The main venues preferred for the main fights were especially appreciated. The fact that the director's vision is so blended with Keanu Reeves and other actors is very effective on the traceability of the film. Stahelski deserves great praise.The film also brings new characters. One of them is Sofia, played by Halle Berry. Obviously the audience will love Sofia. Halle Berry has done a great job. Mark Dacascos is one of our main villains; He portrayed the character Zero in the film.Among the action films, it was both a strong story and an ambitious way of action.

tt6146586,1,"Spoiler Alert...this movie is AWFUL.I enjoyed the first two installments of the John Wick franchise, so was looking forward to this movie. I've walked out of three movies in my life, and this one was nearly number four had I not been there with my 19-year-old son who seemed to be enjoying it. To me it was nothing more than watching someone play a first person shooter video game.There was NO story.
There was NO character development.
While the fight scenes were well done, they were too long, too frequent, and frankly they were BORING.This movie was painfully boring.Halle Berry was AWFUL.

tt6146586,3,"Maybe my review will not be relevant to everyone, as I crave more of a inner consistency in a movie, which completely lacked here. I mean, gruesomely kill several people in the packed New York subway and no one notices a thing? And bodies disappear when angle is switched. Come. On.The whole movie had a huge ""Ultraviolet"" feeling. Just pile random characters on, and then slaughter most of them without much of a development or explanation how they fit in the plot. Rush somewhere, kill everyone in sight, cut to the next scene which is just the same as the last one. Over and over and over until the cliche ""end"" which was just an opening for the Chapter 4 movie.I loved the first one, second one was a bit over the top, this one was just ridiculous top to bottom. The movie was actually interrupted because of some false alarm at the theatre five minutes before the end. If it was more than that we would not bother going back in to finish watching it.The biggest joke of itself was the character Zero moment at the bench. It felt like cut out of Despicable Me. The only thing missing there was the Squid Launcher. And he is supposed to be THE toughest thug in the movie? Pull the other one, it has bells on.Three stars for the Morocco fight scene, that was a beauty. But it did not save me and my wife exchanging ""are you bored too?"" glances half the time anyway, so no more than that.",John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum,2019-05-17,7.4,281250,2019

tt6146586,5,"The first John Wick film was special because it broke a mold of sorts. It went against certain action film conventions - the hero was not a muscle bound hulk like a Schwarzenegger or Stallone, the action was super fast paced, the plot was basic and straighforward, but introduced some unique elements, and there was something a bit unique and stylish about the film. John Wick was cool.Then they made a sequel. And while the second film was more ridiculous, less believable, and not as good on any level, it was still John Wick, and still enjoyable.But this third film is out of ideas and is simply rehashing the same things again for a payday (and hey, people seem to like it, so I can't fault them entirely). The magic is gone and it's just another over the top action film. In their attempt to mine more movies out of what was the barest of bare bones plots to start with, they have had to resort to ever increasing gratuitous violence and fight scene gimmicks. I'm no wilting rose, but even I was a bit unsettled by the casual nature of the violence in this film, which surely has one the highest body counts of any film in recent history. It was so over the top it became a bit cartoonish, like watching a video game. There was even the concept of John fighting a series of progressively more important and more difficult ""bosses,"" just like a video game.

John wick kills more people than Rambo and also, no bullet can stop him. Either his enemies have terrible aim or he can dodge bullets like in the matrix (yes, I know his suit is bulletproof but his head is not). He even got the skills to take out 6 or 7 ninjas... damn, can somebody ever stop him?To sum is up, all you're gonna see in this one is: shoot, shoot, kill, shoot, shoot, reload and some more shooting.The last sequence when he falls is also pathetic.

tt6146586,6,"Lets contemplate about components of perfect action movie for a moment- What makes action movies special. Is it it's characters, is it ability to create fantastic choreography or maybe new, shiny special effects. Is it sound design or perhaps a good story ? What will elevate action movie to a new heights? What you need to do to create an instant classic? John Wick 3 creators might not have found all the answers but they definitely created something special and unique.John Wick Parabellum is a direct continuation to the previous movie. It picks up just after 2nd movie finishes, just when John Wick is about to be made excommunicado. The first 20 minutes of the movie are really special and I enjoyed it immensely. John Wick needs to escape from the never ending wave after wave of assassins who try to collect very large bounty put on his head. In a city filled with assassins controlled by secretive yet very powerful and feared organization this is not an easy task. Assassins are everywhere here, on every corner of every street, which actually begs a question. Are there are any normal people left in the world?The stunts from the start to finish were really special, some of them really unique and brutal. People were gasping in the cinema, me including. The sheer unfiltered violence and constant fight for survival, this movie does this well. There was even a fantastic sequence featuring German shepherds, the scene with the dogs added more excitement to brutal showcase of John Wick's and Halle Berry's gun skills. It felt like a continues shot, maybe even it was. When camera was rolling and following dogs attacking army of villains, this was very fluid and kept me on my toes from start to finish. Let me tell you this again, this movie does this sort of action really, really well.Where it falls short is the actual story. There was an opportunity here to do more with the story, unfortunately it took a backstage here or maybe even left the fast moving Wick's car and stayed on the side lines as what we got here is a predictable plot with predictable twists and really not that interesting main character. Even Polar has better story than JW. John's motives are confused here, his choices do not make much sense and his strategic thinking leaves a lot to be desired.It does not work for John's benefit, it makes him rather not so special - a flat and shallow character, apart of amazing survivability skills he has nothing else to offer. Is he really just a blunt weapon, tip of the spear, instrument of destruction. What is the whole point of this destructive adventure? We have here this faceless organization, their cruel motives and ways, their world dominance. Movie fails to explain this to us more. The story and subsequently the movie is lacking depth !Remember that this is a pure action movie, however special it is, misses this final piece of the puzzle in its attempt of becoming instant classic and is sadly just punching above waist, becoming average movie which will definitely entertain you but will leave you begging for answer and more, more sense and more emotions.

tt6146586,6,"Fantastically choreographed action, especially in the first 30 minutes.

It's' just straight up action. That's it. If you like that, you will love this.Personally though, after about 60 minutes I got a bit tired of the movie, As much as the actions scenes are great, they lacked unqiue elements later on in the movie. There's only so many times someone getting headshotted can be entertaining.I gets a 7 from me, good cinematography, great choreography, average acting at best, okayish script (did not like the ''ending'')",John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum,2019-05-17,7.4,281250,2019

tt6146586,9,"John Wick 3 is without a doubt the best action movie to have come out in a few years. And its so surprising and refreshing to see that movies like this still exist. Most action movies you see is filled with ridiculous amounts of shaky-cam, fast edits and way over-the-top fights. This is perfect. You can see all action clear as day, and by god the stuns in this film are extraordinary. Why the Academy Awards don't award talent like this is beyond me. There were times that I wondered if they had used CGI, because someone nuts must be willing to throw themselves from motorbikes and through glass. But whatever case it is, its a dam joy to watch.As with the previous 2 installments, John Wick 3 is where Keanu Reeves is at home. This role was just made for him, and watching him stand toe to toe with powerhouses like Halle Berry, Ian McShane, Laurence Fishburne and Anjelica Huston, not only shows how good he is as an action star, but as an actor in general. He hasn't been given a role this good since the Matrix, but those movies never showed how good he was just at acting. He sells this movie.The supporting cast is all amazing, and I loved how they left their character's hanging, giving us hope of seeing them in future installments. I also loved how more in-depth the movie spent on world-building. The way it brings in different cultures into this assassin guild is done very well.John Wick 3 is an amazing action movie that never loses its steam throughout, and its 2 hour run times flies past, because of non-stop action that is directed and choreographed to perfection. I can't wait to see if they manage to pull off the 4th like they did here.8.8/10",John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum,2019-05-17,7.4,281250,2019

tt0448115,10,"They must have superhero fatigue. Why? This movie is at the very least comparable to every other. Here's what this movie has:First, a lot of really genuinely good comedy. You aren't going to laugh at dirty jokes, you aren't going to laugh at corny jokes, you're going to laugh at genuinely well written and performed comedy. In fact, probably soon to be one of the most iconic comedic moments in superhero movies to date with Shazam and his foe.Second, this movie has more than one cameo. The entire team did a great job of keeping a secret cameo (and it's not the one that people might think of at the very end).Third, this has such a great portrayal of Foster families. Very often movies have these really negative, terrible portrayals of Foster kids and the families they go into. The family that Billy gets into genuinely care about each other. It's easy to see why Billy would want to accept them. Especially after you find out some information which I will not reveal here.One common criticism is that this movie forces drama between the comedic parts and that it doesn't work well. This is only somewhat true. The drama is believable, but it's a little forced, but let me play devil's advocate. We have gotten very used to incredibly great dramas, but not every movie can have this. It's a superhero movie. In all honesty, the drama in most superhero movies always comes second. It is never really THAT captivating. This shouldn't be held up to the standard of great dramas films. Really, no superhero movie should. With that being said, I find the motivation for the villain to be persuasive. Imagine that you are a child that is being bullied. Typically if you cannot rely on your family and friends to help, you're going to probably grow up with anger in your heart. In this case, he has no friends and his family ARE the bullies. Someone criticized this, but they're completely wrong. That's a strong motivation to be someone who wants to take his anger out on others (especially family).Another thing I love about this movie is that Billy is never really just motivated to start doing good. He shows that he is willing to do good. He protects Freddy from being beat up, but only when it's gone too far. He's chosen by the Wizard not because he is some perfect, good-hearted child, but because he has the potential to be exactly that. The fact that he's willing to protect Freddy from bullies and that he gets his powers, then doesn't immediately start to save everyone shows the writers knew exactly what they were doing. This isn't some shortcut to being a good person. It doesn't show that he does all of the very funny things he does just to.make the audience last. He's learning. He's still not perfect. It's only when he has to save people from a problem that he created that he even remotely starts to start trying to understand the responsibility he carries. It's not until he begins to accept his foster family as his real family does he really understand the importance of helping others. You have to remember that he's always been a loner. He's never really experienced love since.. well, you'll see, but NEVER. In fact, I don't even think he's fully understood by the end of the movie. He's still learning. And why wouldn't he be? He's only 14.
This movie is absolutely great. It's much more than okay. It's honestly better than most comic book movies I've seen in awhile, but for different reasons than the other traditional superhero movies (like I said, this movie has those traditional elements, but also much more). The only way that it is ""just okay"" is if you have some serious superhero fatigue.",Shazam!,2019-04-05,7,262444,2019
tt0448115,7,"It was pretty much exactly what I expected which is a really enjoyable and lighthearted superhero film with some funny moments and that will be enough for most people but it just didn't blow me away. No way this is a 10 like some are suggesting and to nitpick, adult Billy acts nothing like young Billy at all. Don't get me wrong - its still a fun movie which I can recommend.",Shazam!,2019-04-05,7,262444,2019
tt0448115,6,"Technically a 6.5, but definitely not anything to be thrilled about, as there isn't much novelty. I'm not familiar with the comics so I had no special expectations. I can honestly say it was a fun movie, but I just don't see where the glowing praise is coming from.Story-wise, it does its job without much surprise or imagination. The little drama with Billy searching for his long-lost mom, while being unable to accept companionship from others, is alright. The special FX are good, but there aren't any mindblowing scenes (no real fighting or magic other than smoke and lightning). I didn't mind the villain being one-note, but I wish they did something better than the old ""7 deadly sins,"" or at the very least been more creative with the designs (which look like clay concept models of generic gargoyles and you couldn't even tell which sin was which).Maybe I'm just cynical, but I didn't find it very funny. Sure I had a few smirks and chuckles now and then, but there wasn't anything roaringly hilarious. If the trailers didn't exactly make you LOL, then you'd probably won't within the full movie. The comparisons to a kid-friendly Deadpool are apt, but without the wackiness that ""seals the deal"" as most of the jokes are simple/cheesy/cheap (At the very beginning, Billy steals a cop's lunch bag while he pleads against it. Later on he uses his adult form to buy beer and visit a strip club like every teenage boy's wishes. That's pretty much the bar of humor throughout, besides the numerous ""Look what I can do!"" moments of discovery for the powers.)There's a large disconnect between the ever-brooding Billy and the upbeat Shazam, almost like a reverse Jekyll/Hyde. I'd be pretty stoked too if I suddenly gained superpowers, but neither character is a natural extension. And except for Freddy, everyone is entirely one-dimensional and stereotypical: overly enthusiastic foster parents, the tech-wizard gamer Asian, the sweet 16-type daughter going off to college, bullies, etc. Billy has probably less than 10 minutes shown interacting with the fosters that him eventually accepting them as family is a giant, unsatisfying leap.Overall, it's highly forgettable, but kids will enjoy it, assuming they won't be affected by the CG monsters.",Shazam!,2019-04-05,7,262444,2019
tt0448115,6,"If you measure this film against other DCEU movies it's pretty good, but stand it on it's own and it just isn't. The biggest problem with the movie is its tone - is this movie for kids or adults? The thin plot and hokey bits don't play for adults and the strip club and demons biting off peoples heads don't play for kids. My own kids wanted to like the film but nightmares about the demons and an unwanted conversation about why Shazam wanted to go see naked ladies turned them both off. As an adult, the super simple story and ridiculously over the top antagonist were big turnoffs. I think we all want to like this film, and that we all want DC to make good movies. Unfortunately this is another miss.",Shazam!,2019-04-05,7,262444,2019
tt0448115,9,"I got to see an early screening of Shazam! at my local theater, and boy did it not disappoint. It's not flawless, but the good outweighs the bad more often than not. With a bright story, boundless energy, and an irresistible sense of fun, this is certainly one of the best-if not the best-installment of the DCEU so far.Direction: I feel like David Samberg is the DCEU's Taika Waititi. He's this movie director that really isn't known for much past some horror, which made him an initially odd choice for this movie; a choice that paid off tremendously. He helps some light shine into this world, but doesn't underplay the action. His direction and coordination through framing helps us laugh and, in some cases, feel the punches. The action isn't jolty like the other DCEU installments and due to the bright vibrant colors, we really know what's happening, where it's happening, and who it's happening to. Well done.The writing was uneven, but definitely fun. It's a basic story that converts Billy Batson's origin into a modern-day retelling with some elements of Big in there. The humor is well-timed and consistently funny; a lot of meta jokes and inner humor help the story obtain its brighter feel. The relationships written in are heartfelt and the story itself has a lot of heart. One part that causes a rift is the central character of Billy. His two versions, between the adult and the kid, seem to be two completely different people. It's an inconsistency that's fine being just about the only part (besides typical villain problems) that bugs you about the writing.Performances: I swear, Zachary Levi was born to play Shazam! He carries childlike enthusiasm and a heart in effortlessly. He oozes charisma and really... I won't be able to say it enough so here it is: Zachary Levi is perfection. The rest... Kid Billy was somewhat toned down but still played quite nicely. Mark Strong played a menacing villain. The child actors, especially Jack Dylan Fraiser (Grazer? I'm sorry I don't remember off the top of my head), were VERY good. Child actors really are improving. Any other supporting performance was played nicely and everyone knew who the real star of the movie was: I'm sorry, I'm gonna keep coming back to this: Zachary Levi is a national treasure.What else... music was nice and heartfelt, I talked about the action sequences... every other part of this film is mainly there to add to Billy's story and I like it. The world is undeniably fun and we're not really pulled out of it.The future is bright for the DCEU with chapters like Shazam! (9/10)",Shazam!,2019-04-05,7,262444,2019

tt0448115,8,"If this was the potential of DCEU, why on earth movies like Justice League, BvS and Suicide Squad even exist? The more I watch films like this, the more I think Snyder was the biggest mistake of DCEU.Good : Zachary Levi is awesome as the adult version of Billy Batson. He can perfectly play an adult who is actually a teenager. His performance is incredible. He has an amazing chemistry with all the other characters which made the experience really good. The movie is an ultimate fun ride from the top to bottom. There's not a single part which felt boring or uninteresting. The arc given to Billy was quite good and we start to like the characters. The comedic parts deliver at its finest. Director Sandberg has shown versatility in a very good way. I have always thought of him as a very good director. His horror films like Lights Out and Annabelle Creation are directed quite well, the major flaws are in the script, if any. Here, there are no such problems with the script, and he understands very well how a certain part of the story is to be directed. Some parts do have a nice horror movie vibe to it, but it is not tonally inconsistent. It knows what it tries to be, and doesn't take itself too seriously. Even at the times it does, it is for a comedic purpose. It never tries to be an epic film knowing that it's not, unlike BvS. It is sure to put a smile on your face throughout and make you laugh a lot. The final moments are crowd pleasing moments done right.Mixed : It's not a big problem, but I expected more comedy out of this. What I got was great, but I wanted a lot more of funny stuff. The kid playing teen Billy Batson isn't a bad actor. But some of the times, it felt like him and Levi were a little different with each other. It could've been a little better.Bad : The villain was a clichéd villain. He wasn't interesting as a character like Thanos, Ledger's Joker or Bane. Mark Strong does a good job, but this is a poorly written villain.Conclusion : An entertaining superhero film which knows what it is, and is quite campy in a good way. It is not wildly original concept of a film. It has some popular tropes of the genre and has a familiar template for an origin story. But it will definitely keep you entertained till the end, and you will end up liking most of the characters. The best thing is, even if you have never seen a DCEU movie, it won't make a difference.

tt0448115,4,"I honestly thought this was a borderline awful movie. It was classic DC, they overdid the suspense to the point where it got boring. First of all, the set up to the story was very repetitive and took way too long. Secondly, the animations of the ""bad guys"" was very poor. The biggest problem I have with this movie is that the fight scenes were very disappointing and consisted of people running away the whole time. The main character didn't even use his lightning super powers once again the main villain.... what? No one got hurt even once in this movie, there seemed to be no stakes at all. At least half an hour of the movie was dedicated to the super hero running away from the villain. It was just so monotonous and poorly done. Lastly, this movie was made out to be much funnier than it actually was in the ads. The pros of this movie just do not outweigh the cons. This is coming from someone who usually likes most movies. I just cannot support this one.",Shazam!,2019-04-05,7,262444,2019

tt0448115,6,I've seen some reviews before and this movie was supposed to be somehow good. It really was just meh.

tt0448115,10,"Despite the fun and family friendly looking movie, DC didn't lose its identity as a dark comic universe which we all love , SUPER recommend 😉",Shazam!,2019-04-05,7,262444,2019
tt0448115,7,"This film loaded with silly humour, but it actually got some clever laughs and its heart is in the right place. When I say that this film has its heart in the right place I mean that it manages to get the balance of comedy and sentimentality without crossing too far over the line into cheesiness. Billy's story involves him not being happy in his foster home and trying to search for his mum. I felt sad for Billy. However, the way we get to know his new foster family, with all their individual quirks, shows us that he's in a safe and loving environment with genuinely good people. It's nice.
When it comes to the superhero stuff I think this film manages to do well at demonstrating action scenes via the use of amazing visual effects. Perhaps near the end the film turned into something we've seen many times before, but it looked good while it was happening. The performances really carry this movie; Zachary Levi suited the role. Because he is actually playing a 14 year old boy he has to portray that convincingly - which he does with ease. He's really funny, and also looked suited to the action stuff as well. But one issue is that, the personalities between the adult and young Billy doesn't match, Zachary Levi is more convincing that's he's a 14 year old boy than younger Billy is. He come as across as very childish as an adult than he is a 14 year old. I hope they correct that in the sequel. Jack Dylan Grazer is pure comedy throughout this movie. His mannerisms are just as impressive as the words coming out of his mouth. He, which was a true supporting performance. Few minor issues i had with the movie is that the villain was too weak and the film did felt slightly too long. In the latter stages when the comedy was lessened and the serious stuff took over I did feel the film begin to lose its identity. The quirky comic superhero film was starting to look like all the others. I know they have to have the big battle between the hero and villain; but it almost lost me when all that stared.
All in all, Shazam is an enjoyable film with some positive morals going on. It has a lots of charms and a fine balance between humor and seriousness.",Shazam!,2019-04-05,7,262444,2019
tt0448115,8,"There is no questions that ""Shazam!"" has a plethora of good things going for it. What stands out about this unlike the other films from the DC Extended Universe is that ""Shazam!"" succeeds in staying original and not only that it plays off a lighter theme as opposed to the dark and gritty material you see in superhero movies where everything is political, philosophical or educational making it more labouring to watch than fun. It seems like ""Shazam!"" is following the footsteps of Marvel superhero films leaning towards humour like ""Deadpool"" and ""Spider-Man Into the Spider-Verse"" albeit a little less satirical in its delivery.The simplified theme of the leads you to the question of what would happen if a 14-year-old kid was suddenly given super powers, not knowing what to do with them? The closest movie of that theme goes to 2010's ""Kick-Ass"", albeit no powers to go with the costume, but a strong fan-following on social media. With the exception of our superhero walk into a strip bar and facing off against demonic looking gargoyles who represent the Seven Deadly Sins, ""Shazam!"" is for the most part light and more aimed towards the younger aged demographics even with the simple message relating to the importance of loving one's family and showing love to the people around you.Although it might be following the footsteps of comedy superhero like films like ""Deadpool"", the movie seem more inspired on the surface of the light-comedy children's film ""Big"" from 1988 starring a very young Tom Hanks. In this movie and in ""Big"" we see a kid making the transformation of an adolescent boy into a fully grown adult. It's a great combination to take the idea of a kid growing up fast comedy by adding superhero powers to it is original and works on all sorts of levels.For the action to really start picking up you need a great deal of patience as you'll have to sit there and watch the tedious origin story of the troubled childhood of young Billy Batson (Asher Angel) and the origin story of Dr. Thaddeus Sivana (Mark Strong) and how he turned evil; not to mention he also had the cliched daddy issues. Once that is all out of the way, it's where the excitement takes over from there. Billy is now living an orphan and still has a fixation of finding his mother who abandoned him, though when he finds her the revelation is quite anti-climactic. When Billy was called upon a powerful Wizard (Djimon Hounsou) he was granted six mystical powers that represented the strengths of six mythological characters though all he has to say is ""Shazam"" and he can transform into his superhero form and back into a teenager again. His transition to the more buff Zachary Levi reminiscent to when David Banner transforms into The Incredible Hulk.Under the direction of David F. Sandberg, under the metaphoric Superhero Origin Manual in which our novice superhero must adjust to his new powers by making each awkward scene all the more entertaining because when you first obtain new things it's natural that people feel uncertain when something seems alien to them. When Billy was trying out his new powers, he experimented on what he could do with them, along with his fellow foster sibling Freddy Freeman (Jack Dylan Grazer). What's funny is he's not using his powers to take down evil people and saving the world from corruption, he's more interested in using it to his advantage for his own selfish and mischief making ways.But once Billy adjusts to his newly obtained adult-formed alter-ego, ""Shazam!"" falls into formulaic territory as he must take down the evil Dr. Sivana which they battle all across Philadelphia (though it was actually filmed in Toronto), feels like a poor person's version of Superman vs. Zod in ""Superman II"", though just very watered down. In the end, the climax doesn't end with something to look back on.The big weakness is that the film goes on way too long and kids might get restless knowing that this movie does go on for more than two hours. Not only that some subplots just don't seem to work out at times. Sandberg successfully can balance out the superhero action, the comedy and the dramatic scenes very nicely and well-timed without one genre usurping the other. The comic-book scenes are one we've seen many times before which is formulaic, but always exciting. The comedy genre is the strongest of the aforementioned ones as I had laughed quite a lot in this movie due to the perfect timing of Zachary Levi. Sure ""Shazam!"" won't be in the same leagues as ""Captain Marvel"" or ""Avengers: Endgame"", it still provides two hours plus of solid lightweight entertainment for all.",Shazam!,2019-04-05,7,262444,2019

It could have been soooo good and funny, but all the good parts were put into the trailer, with the rest of the movie dragging on forever.

tt0448115,5,"SHAZAM! is a weird movie. The stuff it does right is done very well, but the stuff it does wrong it does horribly. I was able to catch an early screening of the film on March 23 so, naturally, the theatre was packed with eager fans. I'll get to it later, but this audience would go on to become an instrumental part of my negative film-going experience.As for the movie itself, the cast is the easy highlight. Zachary Levi does a really fantastic job as Shazam and perfectly captures the fun and innocence of being 15 years old. Asher Angel plays his ""alter-ego,"" Billy Batson, and when he is given the opportunity he really shines in dramatic scenes. Another stand-out was Jack Dylan Grazer's comedic performance as Billy's best friend, Freddy Freeman. Mark Strong plays the antagonist, Dr. Thaddeus Sivana, though his talent as an actor is wasted in the minimal screen time he is given. Besides a few poor actors such as the little sister and the two bullies from their school, the cast was quite excellent. In particular, a scene in a convenience store was very well done from an acting/writing point-of-view. The action is also pretty good. Though it is nothing all too special, it kept my attention, and I was never bored during the action scenes (which is something I cannot say for other DCEU films). They found many creative ways of utilizing Shazam's abilities, especially the power of changing between a kid and a super-powered adult. As well, the special effects were very effective and never felt fake or cheap. While this film doesn't have as much VFX as most superhero films do, the scenes where they are most prominent are quite good, save for some strange-looking creatures primarily featured in the third act. To round out the pros, the best thing about this movie is how fun it can be when it's not taking itself too seriously. It knows what it is, and relishes in that. Unfortunately, that's where the pros end and the long list of cons begin.This movie is so poorly written. It is one of the most predictable superhero films I have ever seen, and that's saying a lot. I don't just mean in terms of how the overall story will play out, but also individual scenes and jokes. Things are set up so obviously that it is impossible to not know what the payoff will be. If you're watching a scene and you think you know where it's going, then that's likely what's going to happen in the scene. Even little moments such as characters turning around and seeing their car isn't where it was a moment earlier and it being SO OBVIOUS to the audience that the car is about to fall right in front of them. I know that might seem like a nitpick, but when predictable things like that happen every few minutes, it takes away from the enjoyment of the film. This movie is not only very predictable, but is also not very funny. I'll admit, there were a few moments that made me genuinely laugh, but there are so many jokes in total that the real funny ones likely only comprise 5% of all the comedy in the film. It tries so hard to make the audience laugh that it does the opposite effect for me. For crying out loud, the characters in the film pause after many jokes to give the audience time to laugh. It's hard to sit through at times. Many of the jokes overstay their welcome and go on for way too long, and other jokes are either really obvious slapstick humour or jokes that have been done a million times before. There's one moment when Shazam and the villain are really far apart, and the villain does his generic bad-guy monologue and Shazam can't hear him because they are so far away. This EXACT joke was done (to much better effect, might I add) in Kung Fu Panda 2...eight years ago!This is where my experience with the audience came in. With Shazam, I am convinced that no one in that theatre had ever seen a film before. Every single slightly humorous comment got UPROARIOUS laughter. People were wheezing, gasping for air, and honestly it was annoying because the movie was simply not that funny. People also clapped and cheered a lot, which I found weird because applause works for a film like Star Wars: The Force Awakens or Avengers: Infinity War; big anticipated films that can be akin to a sporting event. But this was Shazam. This wasn't some massive team-up film or a long awaited return of a beloved franchise. Something else that really bothered me was the choice to acknowledge other DC superheroes such as Batman and Superman as icons of popular culture. It makes sense that if superhero really existed they would become icons for which they would sell toys and merchandise, but in this film it seems overdone and creates a few potholes in the continuity of these films. For instance, a kid at the school has a Batman backpack, but within the world that these films have established, Batman was a vigilante that the press and police deemed too brutal as he would brand his ""victims"" with bat symbols on their bodies. Even though he's a very different character in Justice League, I don't know that he's now become a friendly neighbourhood superhero that a five year-old would have a backpack of. Another example is in the toy store scene where they are literally selling toys from the Justice League film, complete with the films logo and the DC logo on the side of the packaging. I know this sounds very nitpicky, but remember that on a film there are hundreds of jobs. Someone's entire job is to decorate the set, another person's job is to work on wardrobe. How did things like this get overlooked? This may seem small, but when you notice these things it makes the film feel lazy and cheap.Moving on, the villain's motivation seemed almost non-existent and seemed like he was evil for the sake of being evil (he even acknowledges at one point how evil he is). Finally, the ""drama"" element of this film felt so forced and underdeveloped. If the filmmakers wanted the strained relationship between Billy and his foster family to be the main focus, why do they devote such little time to developing all of them as characters? The only developed member of that family is Freddy, but his primary focus is on the Shazam/superhero parts of the film. And again, not to nitpick, but the little sister character is given way too much screen time for a character that matters so little. Her only purpose is to make jokes, but in a comedy film we already have many other characters that serve that purpose. I'm also annoyed at the new trend of-in order to put a twist on the stereotype and to be funny-making the little girl character the most defiant and brave character. If a six year old is going to be picked up and almost eaten by a giant monster/demon, she's not going to make some one-liner or boldly tell it to let go of her. She's going to cry and scream and be a realistic depiction of a six year old girl. ""Let go of my brother!"" isn't something a little girl would bravely say to a giant demonic monster, but at least my audience got a kick out of it.This film jumps the line back and forth from taking itself very seriously to acknowledging the silliness of the concept and having fun with it. At one moment, I'm expected to care about whether or not Mary is going to get into the college of her choice, and next I'm shown a homemade video of Shazam trying out his powers. Again, when the movie lets itself have fun it can be enjoyable to watch, it just feels like two people with opposing ideas of how to adapt Shazam for the big screen decided to write this film together. It's very generic and adheres to many of the same tropes that have been done in other superhero films. It presents nothing new and will likely not be remembered in the future as a stand-out within this genre.",Shazam!,2019-04-05,7,262444,2019

We said horrible things to each other we can never take back but we didn't really mean and we both eventually found a way to make it work for him and to protect him from the ugliness. We made it through to the other side and have a good relationship now and work as a team to raise him with love and support but it was a long road out of hell to get there. This movie portrayed that in a way I would never have expected.

tt7653254,10,"With many directors, producers and actors blaming Netflix and other streaming services for what could end up being the end of cinema as we know, the streaming service is releasing several films in theatres for a number of weeks to be eligible for consideration during awards season. Many theatres are boycotting this strategy, so aren't playing Netflix's films at all. The theatres in mostly bigger cities around the world that do play them , are selling tickets like hotcakes. After their short theatrical run, Netflix will make their Original Film available for their members. With Marriage Story, Netflix might even get their first Best Picture award handed over to them.Noah Baumbach's Marriage Story is an incisive and compassionate look at a marriage breaking up and a family staying together. While we flash through important and daily situations, we hear Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) explain what she loves about her husband Charlie (Adam Driver). Charlie loves being a dad, and how it's almost annoying how much he loves it. He cries easily in movies. He's very competitive, undaunted and is very clear about what he wants. These are only a few things Nicole loves about him. After that, it's Charlie's turn to tell us what he loves about his wife Nicole. She's a great dancer - infectious. She's a mother who plays, really plays. She gives great presents. While we hear this couple recite what they've written down, we get to meet them post-break-up in a marriage mediator's office. This was part of an assignment, to fully understand why they got married in the first place. Nicole doesn't want to hear what Charlie has written down, so what's been put in writing is only something we, as the audience, get to hear out loud.What follows then is an emotionally raw journey into growing up, while trying to figure out how to survive on your own. Happiness is a personal feeling and can't be disguised as something as trivial as washing dishes or forgetting a grocery list on your way to the supermarket. We get to know little about Charlie's childhood, but Nicole's family and home are something that's right in the middle of everything. There's also their son Henry (Azhy Robertson), who gets pulled into this. Nicole thinks Henry is just like his father - almost joined to the hip. But when their marriage crumbles, and distance becomes an important factor in Henry's upbringing, their assumptions are solely things that have been witnessed while being together, and are now changing rapidly.The change in personality, after splitting up and having to deal with divorce, becomes very clear in both Nicole and Charlie's behaviour. While Nicole seems very focused, meek and motherly, she turns into a woman who knows what she wants and isn't holding back anymore. The only thing she's holding back in front of Charlie - are tears. As if she doesn't want him to see how vulnerable and damaged she is by everything that's changing. ""Love doesn't make sense"", and no truer words have ever been spoken. Charlie on the other hand, who's always been confident and career driven, is now crumbling down, defeated and uncertain of the future.The cast is phenomenal. Adam Driver is the strongest of the bunch - a transformative, unseen, heartbreaking performance that no one will be able to shut up about during this year's awards season, and deservedly so. Everyone is feeding off his energy and bringing their triple A-game to this truly exceptional film. Scarlett Johansson has never been better, playing a broken woman who wants the best for her family but can no longer wait for her dreams to become reality. Laura Dern as Nicole's divorce attorney is Elle Woods all grown up and commands your attention. Ray Liotta in a comeback to the big screen (his last big film was in 2014's 'Sin City: A Dame To Kill For'), makes you wonder where he's been all this time. Merritt Wever and Julie Hagerty as Nicole's sister and mother don't get much screen time, but are here for some unexpectedly superb comic relief.Baumbach also wrote the film and deserves all the accolades - a true master in writing and directing. He makes all of it seem effortless, with unprecedented results. The way he gets his cast to deliver minutes of dialogue, while his DOP, Robbie Ryan, zooms in and out, follows and swirls around them, to then play with shifting between different actor's facial expressions in silent moments, is utterly enchanting. The cherry on top is Randy Newman coming back to compose a score for a live action film (his last live action film was 2008's 'Leatherheads') - masterful!Marriage Story will get discussed in film school, years from now. It has everything to become an all time classic and will proudly get called one of the best films of the decade.

But it's also amazingly realistic....and painful to watch due to the subject matter.The story is an ultra-realistic story about a marriage that is dissolving...and it's painful because the viewer really grows to like Charlie (Adam Driver) and Nicole (Scarlett Johansson). Like real life, neither character is totally bad and you understand both of their positions during the divorce....but it also is very ugly and awful to see what happens when lawyers get involved. Instead of the amicable divorce they both originally agreed to, it soon becomes ugly....and the pair and their devilish lawyers begin going at each other like pitbulls on a side of beef! Again...this is NOT a criticism...it's realistic and heart-wrenching to watch. I found myself crying during some of the ugliest scenes....and I am sure I wasn't alone in the theater!Overall, you see Johansson and Driver put on some amazing performances....so amazing that I'd be shocked if they aren't at least Oscar-nominated for this film.

Just when I needed it most. This week for me hasn't been the best, a lot of things have been overwhelming for me. The film in a weird way, despite all the events devolving in chaos, told me that things are sometimes awful, unpredictable and emotionally draining but that's ok. The performances, direction, script all came together to deliver something that will always be special to me.This film does have flaws, yes, but I don't really care, films like this only come once in a lifetime.

However.The thing that I don't quite understand is how all the promotional things says that you never side with one or the other. Constantly fluctuating between the two. That was not the case in this movie at all. I found myself constantly siding with Charlie. His wife who lied, manipulated and tried to bankrupt him goes between confused to pure villainy. And when Charlie after quite a long time eventually fires back to keep his child she acts shocked and hurt. When she has dragged him through hell and back while constantly lying about wanting to do things without lawyers or that it's just a formality. But even if you, as I do pick one side.

His writing was also phenomenal, as I found every scene vital to the plot. The script was effectively heart-wrenching and was carried by two awesome leads, at their best. Although the movie was heart-wrenching, there were also other moments when Baumbach offers the audience a laugh, while drawing them back to vulnerabilities of the main characters. The cast was magnificent.

tt7653254,6,"...except no one would want to watch that title because it sounds so depressing.The acting is incredible and deserving of every awards nomination out there. The performances are nuanced, truthful, and deeply honest about the humanity of the characters. The writing does a great job of making the viewer sympathize with both the wife and the husband; each is portrayed by turns as both the villain and the victim, so ultimately both are merely human. The ending, while to me unsatisfying overall, did leave a glimmer of hope that the divorced characters will somehow learn to be friends and make this awkward, fractured-family thing work.However, be warned the whole movie is VERY depressing! I was disappointed that neither character grows or changes from their journey in any significant way. They both end the film just as self-centered and self-serving as they were at the beginning. This is not really a ""marriage story"". A marriage story would have its characters learn some things about commitment and compromise and self-sacrifice for the love of their family. They might learn how to actually work through their issues. But the title is misleading: this is really a divorce story, albeit an honestly-written, exquisitely-acted one, but ultimately a sad, shallow view of marriage.Best Acting? Absolutely. But Best Picture?? No way.",Marriage Story,2019-12-06,7.9,252591,2019

tt7653254,6,"When I first saw the trailer for this film it brought tears to my eyes. It seemed to me like it was going to be a roller coaster of emotions, and I really expected it to be one of the best films of the year. Don't get me wrong, it is by no means a bad movie. The acting is without a doubt some of the best that I have seen, and I believe that both Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson deserve Oscar nominations for how well they did in the film. Unfortunately, I personally was not all that affected by their emotional performances, and had a lot of trouble connecting with their characters. I think older audiences, as well as anyone who has been through a divorce will connect with the film a lot more than I did. That was really my big problem with the film, apart from their child being extremely annoying at times. Other than that, the film is very well made, I did not get bored at any point, although I think it could have been 10 minutes shorter. If it were not for the fact that I felt no attachment to the characters, I would likely give this film a much higher review, likely an 8 or a 9, but I just really wasn't feeling it. Still, definitely a great film in every other regard, and I am likely in the minority about how I felt about the characters, so I would recommend giving it a watch so you can form your own opinion on it.",Marriage Story,2019-12-06,7.9,252591,2019
tt7653254,5,"I came in to this movie hoping for something resembling a story of two adults doing what's best for their child even though they were going through a divorce. What I got was one adult, Charlie (Adam Driver) being dragged through a river of crap by his selfish, child of a wife Nicole (Scarlett Johansson).Although the writers make an effort to portray Nicole as a victim by virtue of her moving to NYC to be with Charlie, the film backtracks on that narrative by Nicole's own admission that she was miserable in L.A. because of her then boyfriend. Nicole needed a change of scenery. Enter Charlie. She met him, moved to NYC, married him, worked with him to create a successful business, and then pulled the rug out from under him once his fame began to surpass her own.In an effort to justify her behavior, Nicole alludes to an ""affair"" Charlie had, but we later learn that it only occurred after he and Nicole were separated but under the same roof. As Charlie put it, he was sleeping on the couch at that point and living with a woman who loathed him for his success and her belief that she gave up too much when she (voluntarily) left L.A.Every act taken by Nicole in this film screams of weakness and insecurity. Nicole can be pushed and pulled in whatever direction anyone wants her to take. She and Charlie agree that they don't want a nasty divorce. So, what does she do? She hires the nastiest divorce lawyer in L.A. at the suggestion of a woman she has known for five minutes. She moves their son to L.A. under false pretenses and files for divorce in L.A. Why? Because her attorney told her to. The goal? To make sure Charlie has to hire an L.A. lawyer at great expense. You see, she knows he can't afford to fight for custody in L.A. But is that enough? Nope. Nicole then goes all over L.A. meeting with other divorce attorneys. Why does she do this (with her kid in tow mind you) when she already has an attorney? To create a conflict of interest in case Charlie wanted to retain a competent attorney of his own. Attorneys can't work with Charlie once she has poisoned the well you see. She does all this to make sure Charlie can't see his child. Meanwhile, she acknowledges how great of a dad he is. ""He does the things for their son that should bother him, and enjoys doing it. To the point that she hates him for it"".This was all done before Charlie even knows what's coming. In the meantime, Nicole continues to shower Charlie with praise and assure him she wants what's best for both of them. But, you see, Nicole is a coward. She cannot fight her own fights, and despite paying tens of thousands of dollars for her attorney (but first making sure that Charlie has to pay 30% of it), she forces her sister to serve Charlie with divorce papers. Why would she make her sister do this when it would only cost a couple hundred bucks to have it done by an actual process server? Well, because this hurts more. Charlie is close with Nicole's family. In fact, it's the only family he has and has ever had. So, naturally, Nicole wants his sister in law to serve him with the divorce papers. ""You have to take a side"" she tells her mom. ""You can't have a relationship with Charlie anymore"" under any circumstances. Why? Because, it's about the hurt. Nicole is an insecure child. Her only satisfaction in this film comes from forcing others to share in her misery.As Nicole drags everyone else into her miserable existence with the hope that it will prop her up, Charlie continues propping up others around him despite his misery. He is a legitimately good person who doesn't deserve the hand he is being dealt. In a fruitless effort to fight for his child, he throws away a $625,000 grant which was supposed to be used for his business. He becomes a victim to a society and a court system that assumes fathers are pieces of crap while mothers can do no wrong. Ironically, at one point in the film Nicole's rabid attorney states the exact opposite, that Nicole needs to be perfect but Charlie can be a buffoon. Those who live in reality know that is not the case. It takes something bordering on child endangerment before a mother loses priority when it comes to custody.Ultimately, Charlie does what every man seems to do in these films. He loses. First he loses his wife because she decides on a whim that New York is no longer good enough. Then he loses his son when she moves him to L.A. under the cover of night. Finally, Charlie loses his livelihood when he can no longer afford to keep the theater open and has to choose between his life's work and his son. As the film closes we see that he has lost once more. He has lost his will to fight. He takes a menial job in Los Angeles (to Nicole's dismay mind you) directing small bit plays. His status as an up and coming Broadway director is gone. Nicole has gotten everything she wanted without even the tiniest compromise. Charlie has lost everything. He has been handed a pile of crap by his wife and is being told in no uncertain terms that he will eat it and tell her how great it tastes. If he refuses, he won't see his child.While it is obvious that Johannson is not Nicole, she embodies her completely, and I personally wonder if I will enjoy her other movies in the future given how despicable a character Nicole is in this film. 5 stars out of 10 for the acting and direction, but the way Nicole's character was written makes me wonder what the goal of this film is. It certainly is not intended to make anyone feel good about the state of humanity as it currently exists.",Marriage Story,2019-12-06,7.9,252591,2019
tt7653254,9,"The movie the attorneys didn't want to be made.In which a loving but separating couple (played by Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson) blow any possibility of a harmonious separation by bringing in their legal aides.It's a sad old movie in which the couple's divorce seesaws from still best friends to raging monsters. Their natural inclination seems to favour behaviour at the friendlier end of the spectrum, but by employing teams of attorneys (at great cost), whose only interests are fiscal and competitive, any of the harmony that remains between Driver and Johansson is cruelly exposed and used as a weakness.In the hands of a director less skilled than Noah Baumbach (Margot at the Wedding, Frances Ha) we could easily have ended up with either a black comedy or an overwrought drama, but this finds a line between the two, by steering a complex and subtle, and lengthy, dialogue (he is the writer) that does not allow the viewer to particularly side with either protagonist - both have their faults and their virtues - but it's the actions of their attorneys that bring out the worst, not the best, in them.That said my wife and I both fell for Driver's side of the story (and only found out afterwards that the movie is based on BaunBach's own experience of divorcing Jennifer Jason Leigh, so maybe it's not quite as agnostic as we thought.It's a slow build, with several long monologues that just finish, mostly, before they outstay their welcomes.But there are also moments of humour. The visit of a social worker is laugh out loud funny and the rehearsal scene where Johansson prepares her terrified sister to hand over the divorce papers is likewise an absolute comic joy.But overall it's both deeply personal and very affecting at times, more than once I was reaching for the Kleenex, and part of that is down to the casting and the highly personal cinematography that shows off the two leads at their most naked (emotionally) and vulnerable with long, lingering close ups on each of them. That's one reason that the big screen is always better than the TV for feature films. Like The Irishman, though, this is a Netflix original and will not be on the big screen for long.Driver is at the top of his game and that means there are three serious Oscar best actor contenders this year - himself, De Niro and Phoenix. All three would win in any average year. Driver's one take performance of Stephen Sondheim's ""Being Alive"" at a piano bar is a real highlight and is about a man';s lack of commitment. It's an excellent counterpoint to Randy Newman's typically accomplished, and in parts quite jaunty, score.Johannson puts in a career-best shift. Not only is his beauty put to one side . No make up and often unflattering close ups, but she acts her socks off.Also of great note is laura Dern's performance as her lawyer and a cameo role for a sprightly, 83 year old, Alan Alda.It's a slow burn but it comes highly recommended from me (and my wife). Just go see it in the cinema.",Marriage Story,2019-12-06,7.9,252591,2019
tt7653254,10,Adam Driver played a very important part! As a person who was older than a normal child going through divorce I realized how hard it was for the father than it was the mother. Driver delivered the part exceptionally well.,Marriage Story,2019-12-06,7.9,252591,2019
tt7653254,7,"This was hard to watch-- depressing and frankly the sort of scary that's so real and implacable it makes you queasy. For the most part, I'd rather not watch movies like this. But my wife popped it on and I didn't want to stop watching the trainwreck as it unfolded on the screen in front of me.Only a few people caught what I did (or everyone is just being polite and ""not going there""): Adam Driver's character, Charlie, gets savaged by his outgoing wife, Nicole (Scarlett Johansson), at least at first. Spoiler: works out relatively peacefully at the end. But only after Nicole makes a stunning show of force to Charlie via the support conferred upon her and all women by the state: she makes it crystal clear to Charlie, and to all us stupid, bad men, by extension, that we but serve at the Queen's pleasure, however petty, brutal, changeable, and self-referential her rule may be. Thankfully, Charlie was not bankrupted, destroyed as a person, or permanently deprived of his child but only because Nicole lacks, constitutionally, the fortitude to follow through on ANY life choice, be it marriage, lifelong career aspirations, or divorce. In other words, if Nicole hadn't been such a shameless coward, the second half of ""Marriage Story"" would only have detailed Charlie's abject evisceration on the floor of a family court room, with even his son cheering his annihilation. He wouldn't have been able to stop her.The few reviewers who saw this dimension of the story expressed the view that the filmmakers must have wanted the audience to sympathize with Nicole and not Charlie. I disagree. I suspect the filmmakers rather sided with Charlie in terms of his much greater legal vulnerability compared to Nicole's. Why else belabor the point? Of course, we want the narrative to strongly denounce its villains, but that is not possible here, not in our thoroughly gynocentric world. The point had to be made in a subtle and understated way to make it to the big screen. That doesn't make it any less painful to watch, but hopefully some younger men who may be considering marriage will watch this movie and heed its implicit warnings about the overwhelming social and legal power of women in our social order. Charlie felt he was treated like a criminal and all it took was his wife basically calling him one. If you have ears to hear, then listen...In short, hard to watch and very sad, but a good reminder for those of us married men who have already red-pilled to remember the risk we accepted when we married and, perhaps optimistically, a strong hint to single men to be aware of the shadow side of married life and their relationships with women in general that society tends to hide from them.",Marriage Story,2019-12-06,7.9,252591,2019
tt7653254,8,"Although every story is individual, the film captures a couple of important general realities about the state of modern divorce:1) Many divorces shouldn't happen and that includes this divorce as it was portrayed.The couple had plenty of regard for each other which was demonstrated in several portrayed interactions between them. The divorce appears to be mostly motivated by their differing professional aspirations. No matter how justified these may have been, in my moral judgment they should have been secondary to providing a stable home for their child. Perhaps the saddest aspect of our modern society is that many of us fail to realize that life is best experienced by subjugating our own needs to those around us, most particularly within our immediate family and even more particularly to our minor children. This form of narcissism seems more prevalent in show business where successful careers depend on self promotion and that may explain why people in that occupation appear to divorce at a higher rate.2) Our legal system exacerbates the divorce experience for those who have assetsIn most cases at the time that the decision to divorce is made, the ensuing pain is underestimated by the couple. Rather than the anticipated experience of freedom and removal of a burden, the loss of companionship causes considerable pain and grief which is most often redirected as anger toward the other spouse. If the couple have assets and hire attorneys, it is in the financial interest of the legal professionals who are billing hourly to take advantage of this acrimony. Many family law lawyers are like the Alan Alda character in the film and do their best to address the emotional needs of their clients despite this financial reality but there are others who do not. Too often divorces cause huge financial pain for both parties.",Marriage Story,2019-12-06,7.9,252591,2019

tt7653254,9,"""Marriage Story"" is a film about a couple which is going trough the phases of a divorce. The best thing about this movie is that the characters, the two protagonists in particular, have a very human taste and they seem like real people feeling real emotions. And thanks to the excellent performances by Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson these emotions are able to touch the heart of the viewer with all their power and at the same time with a delicate taste. As far as the theme of the divorce the movie is a critic about the process of it, on how it makes the couple waste a lot of money but most importantly on the hate it creates. Indeed the protagonists starts the process with all the good intentions to split up peacefully but when the lawyers kicks in they found themselves in a fight they don't even want. And another aspect ""Marriage Story"" manages to get right is that both Charlie and Nicole had their faults and they also had been disrespected in different ways and so the movie conveys the idea that in these situations usually (not everytime) the blame is on both, maybe not equally but everyone had his faults.

tt7653254,4,"I was repeatedly embarrassed while watching Marriage Story.The wild tonal shifts (the consistent insistence on sitcom-level farce/borderline slapstick - perhaps especially pre-serving the papers) repeatedly derailed my ability to take anything or anyone seriously. The theatre troupe scenes were terrible (""A four-time Oscar-winner was sucking my-"" why is this sequence/character in this film?). The abundance of overwritten monologuing. The cloying and contrived reappearance of the letter. Nicole's (Scarlett Johansson, who overall fares better than Driver) big ""It's a game I'm playing with myself!"" moment at the poolside. Their *big fight* (which made me snicker with how phony and forced it was, then appalled by the pseudo-disturbing revelation from Driver). Ordering his lunch for him at the lawyers' meeting, then tying his shoe for him. Pukey, honestly.I'm shocked by the film, and the almost universally positive reactions, especially as this is from the same artist who made one of the great films about an ugly divorce: The Squid and the Whale.There are moments and sequences that work, and even work very well, and some of the acting has special moments of high quality work (from Laura Dern and Alan Alda, especially), but the film as a whole doesn't work at all. I was especially stricken by a scene from the film's shamelessly manipulative second half, as it seems to best reflect a repeated problem with several sequences. It comes when Charlie (Adam Driver) gets up to sing Sondheim's ""Being Alive"" in front of his troupe, then goes to sit down after some awkwardness and mild friendly praise, but then inexplicably stands again and sings more - the rest of the song, in fact - and the film wants so desperately for this sequence to be telling and revelatory, and yet it moves from what starts to approach camp before stumbling into a desperate reach for his character's (clunky) pained lament(s).

Charlie is a NY lover, Nicole is from LA and allegedly put her movie career on hold when she moved to NY to work for hubby Charlie's theatrical productions.The couple is going through a rough patch, when after ten years in NY, Nicole receives an offer to star in a TV pilot and moves back to LA, with her mum and sister, bringing son Henry with her. Nicole wants a divorce ASAP, while Charlie still thinks they are getting back together and does not catch the drift until he is served papers.Enter divorce lawyers, in the shape of obnoxious Nora Fanshaw (Laura Dern), working for Nicole, while Charlie hires - in succession - two lawyers with different degrees of aggressiveness (and hourly fees).What we have here is two highly narcissistic people, who want to pursue their careers and find that family gets in their way. Nicole wants to do more than acting, but Charlie never allowed her to direct. With divorce comes the freedom to do so, because what the world needs is yet another director - what a shame would have been for humankind if Nicole missed her chance.On the other hand, Charlie, described as self-involved, seems quite lethargic in most situations, especially when spending ""quality time"" with brat - I mean, beloved son - Henry.

tt6139732,8,"As soon as this live action version of Aladdin was first announced, it seems certain people were against it. While I too have fond memories of seeing the original animated version at the theatre, I was at least willing to give this one a chance. I'm glad I did. Firstly, people need to realise an animated film and live-action film are two different things. Some things that work in animation just won't translate too well into live-action. The other thing to accept is that, short of resurrecting Robin Williams, there was no way they were ever going to be able to replicate his unique take on the character of the Genie. Once you open your mind to the possibility that something can be 'different' but also *good*; then you'll have a more pleasant experience. That's what we get here: a movie that is familiar, but at the same time new/different (and that's not a bad thing).From the very beginning, the movie is somewhat different to what we might be expecting when we're introduced to who is telling the story. While it was immediately evident to me what was going on, it wasn't a 'bad' addition. After sweeping shots set to the song 'Arabian Nights', we're introduced to the 'street rat' named Aladdin. Although much fuss has been made about the Genie casting, if Aladdin had been miscast, then the whole film would've suffered. Thankfully, I can say that I almost immediately liked Mena Massoud in the role. He's funny, got moves/charm, makes for a likeable 'thief' and his relationship with his pet monkey, Abu, is as good as I'd hoped it'd be. Speaking of, although people think of CGI characters badly a lot of the time, it must be made clear the animal companions in this are all wonderfully brought to life/fully-realised characters. Abu is expressive, funny, and helpful (despite sometimes getting them both into trouble).Not before long Aladdin encounters Princess Jasmine (a well-cast Naomi Scott, who does a lot with the character and should make most Jasmine fans proud), who's undercover among the people. I was afraid that the movie would rush through their first meeting, but was happy with the amount of time devoted to them developing an interest in each other. I could instantly tell that the beloved character of Jasmine was in safe hands as portrayed by Naomi Scott and that she had nice chemistry with Massoud's Aladdin. Although not given as much to do as Abu, Jasmine's loyal tiger companion, Rajah, is another lovely animal created with CGI, who I appreciated wasn't largely ignored. Jasmine's other loyal friend, her handmaiden named Dalia, is actually a stand-out character in the movie. Nasim Pedrad has excellent comic timing, as does Naomi Scott, which is on full display in a fun scene where Aladdin comes to the palace and Jasmine attempts to maintain her cover.The one 'miss' in the casting department is that of Marwan Kenzari as villainous Jafar. While others had pre-judged him based on the trailers alone, I was willing to give him a chance to make up for his lack of sinister voice with what would hopefully be at least a menacing performance. Sadly, he lacks even that. There's nothing particularly memorable about his portrayal (even near the end when he's given every opportunity to unleash in full-on villain mode, he falls way short). About the only 'positive' I could find regarding his character is his animal companion of Iago. The red parrot might not be quite as talkative as the animated version, but he *does* talk (and in a much more bird-like way), getting a few funny lines here and there (I'd expect nothing less from Alan Tudyk providing the voice). It's just disappointing that Jafar's miscast, and thus the 'weak link' in the film.What most people are probably wondering about is Will Smith as the Genie. I actually thought he was pretty good here (and I found him more likeable in this role than I have in any movie I've seen him in since probably the first Men In Black). There are just one or two instances where I felt he tried to emulate Robin Williams' version and it didn't quite work, but on the whole I felt he brought his own energy/style to the character of Genie and it (mostly) worked. The most important thing was the friendship that he formed with Aladdin. While Smith's Genie may seem a bit more snarky than you might expect, when it comes to the emotional beats, his performance hits the right notes (especially near the end).Speaking of notes, ""What about the songs?"" you may ask. I was pretty happy with them, there were just the right amount and they didn't feel particularly intrusive in any of the scenes they were featured. Even the new song, 'Speechless', isn't too bad (though there are those who'll no doubt complain). Massoud and Scott have really nice singing voices and did their songs justice, I thought. Will Smith's also decent with his main songs in the movie (the end credits one I could've done without, though).I must also praise the costumes (Jasmine's are all stunning, as is Jasmine herself), the use of vibrant colours is quite impressive and the overall look of the film feels like something new/different to what we've seen time and time again in films (especially Disney ones). Things I forgot to mention: the Magic Carpet has as much 'character' as in the original (I especially appreciated seeing how close friends Carpet and Abu became by the end), and even the Sultan's head guard, Hakim, is given some depth.In conclusion, if you go into the theatre already disliking/hating the film based on just the trailers, then you're probably going to leave the same way you entered: bitter and thinking things like ""It ruined my childhood!"" (such a rubbish statement). Just try accepting this is a different thing and hopefully you'll enjoy it.",Aladdin,2019-05-24,6.9,231225,2019
tt6139732,3,"What's to say. Before even filming we knew Guy Ritchie was obviously the wrong choice to direct the film. His style doesn't quite lend itself to this type of film.
Miscast Mena Massoud didn't bring any real character to the role of Aladdin he was simply okay/ functional.
Will Smith is as usual charismatic and had difficult shoes to fill after Robin Williams' take on the genie but he was seriously let down by the VFX in blue genie mode and a weak script.
Another miscast Naomi Scott gave a good performance but I always felt i was looking at Indian and not Middle Eastern. In fact the film IS very bollywood with the Jasmin, Aladdin dance off Indian Style (and to Indian music) then Russian dancing(?) plus other times an Indian soundtrack.
And i'm not even going to talk about that sorry excuse for a villain. No, no i am not.
For a Disney movie set in large Kingdom it sure does feel quite quite small. It looked cheap too. Weird.

He does fantastically well in his own right. Absolutely loved the Prince Ali song where Aladdin enters the city as the prince. Brilliantly colorful spectacle captured really well. Jafar missed a little for me as had lost the smarmy-ness of the animated version. The songs were great and the Aladdin and Jasmine characterization was pretty spot on.

tt6139732,3,"Like many of the Disney live action adaptations, this film utterly fails to understand what made the original so great to begin with. Moments of character growth or interaction feel rushed and are changed up from the original, yet the outcome in the story still illogically remains the same. Some of the additional scenes around new characters simply feel laughable and out of place.
The additional song written for this film heavily clashes with the musical style of the existing ones and the instrumental accompaniment of the songs in general sounds too modern and not like a classical musical anymore.
The humor in this movie is very hit and miss. Some lines and moments are indeed extremely enjoyable, while most others seem too forced.
The VFX in this film are not entirely up to task and will undoubtedly look dated in a few years time. Most importantly, the overall spectacle feels much less impactful than the original's.
Overall, there would be much more to go into. But this should be enough in summary.",Aladdin,2019-05-24,6.9,231225,2019
tt6139732,3,"I have only ever walked out of one movie before. This would have been the second one if it wasn't for the fact I was at the end of a row and didn't want to disturb two young families. It was so boring and yet should have been so good.There were so many chances missed. It's set in Arabia and yes the sets and scenery were amazing, but we never got a chance to enjoy them. The film kept skipping from scene to scene with little or no shots of anything apart from the actors. It should have and could have been both magical and beautiful. Couldn't we have seen Jasmin explore the city a little before bumping in Aladdin? That also would have made her character more rounded and show us how trapped she was in the palace.I totally fell in love with Aladdin from the animated film and had a teenage crush on him for years (yes, ok, he's an animated character I know, but don't judge me). This Aladdin lacked the animated version's spark and determination and worst of all kindness. He briefly hands a child some dates and that's about it. We don't get to see why he helps Jasmin in the market, it's all too rushed and so their relationship never really feels real and left me really not caring whether they ended up together or not.The songs, whilst sung quite well, didn't seem to fit into the film and every time one of them burst into song it felt false and like it had been crowbarred in.All in all it was a real disappointment and left me grieving for what might have been.",Aladdin,2019-05-24,6.9,231225,2019
tt6139732,1,"Talk about the wrong cast and cheap visual effects. This is a childhood favorite of mine and was really looking forward to seeing it come to the big screen again. If you are into Indian movies and Bollywood I assume you might like it. This isn't an indian folklore people, why would you direct and cast it in such a way? Where is the Aladdin that keeps you on the edge of your seat with excitement? Where is the story telling that keeps you enticed and pulls you into the movie? Where is the wonder in the cave of wonders? Where is the feeling of flying a magic carpet? Where is the Aladdin we all can relate to and inspires us to be better? Where is the family relationship we can all relate to?
NOWHERE....that's the problem; was this movie rushed? Why was the production/direction so bad? Was there not enough budgeting? Were you guys on a deadline? WIll Smith is an amazing actor, and as always carried this movie onto the big screen; but he isn't Robin William. I was actually laughing most of the time at the lines. I honestly hope not all disney re-make movies are going to be done with the same standards.You know how sometimes you hear someone try and retell a joke and they just totally butcher it?

tt6139732,2,"The animation is one of my all time favourite Disney films. Full of laughs, heart, emotion and an incredible story. This was just a total mess. The lead actor is so incredibly wooden, and emotionless, the only good thing going for him is his fantastic dance moves (maybe stick to that from now on). Will Smith is good but forgettable. I totally get that he was trying to make it his own but I'm sorry nothing can out do Robin Williams, and unfortunately that's what this film would have needed to make it great, someone even better than the original. The actor that plays Jafar is next. AWFUL, not menacing enough and it makes for a very lack-lustre performance. Naomi Scott on the other hand was absolutely brilliant as Jasmine. Her voice when she sings Speechless gave me goosebumps. She is the only reason that I gave 2 stars instead of 1. Maybe Disney needs to stop the live action now, I'm really dreading The Lion King and Mulan now as they're both 2 more favourites. Fingers crossed.",Aladdin,2019-05-24,6.9,231225,2019

Is this another PC thing Disney's shoving down our throats? Because honestly I don't think it was a big deal.

Critics are really being harsh and I can't believe that beauty and the beast was more critically praised. The movie was so bland and boring while this one has so much energy and life to it. The characters had amazing chemistry with each other and the lines were delivered smoothly. The two things I was worried about that subsided as soon as the movie started are:
1- Jafar's character: Marwan tries his best to make but the material he's given isn't strong enough. I wish they developed his character more. However, I didn't mind the change they did it with his character as it fits more with this version.
2- Cultural representation: The trailers made the movie look like a production from bollywood. Not hating on the Indian culture, but it really annoyed me as Arab to see a Middle Eastern/Arabic folk tale that we all know long before Disney introduced it to the world to be represented in a fully different culture. Fortunately, the movie looks and feels way more Arabian such Arabic writings here and there, hearing some people speaking Arabic briefly, the names and appearance of the people of Agrabah and of course the amazing score! Although there are some slight hints of India/South Asia in the clothing and dancing, but I didn't mind that at all.I would've give it a 10 if the cinematography was better. This is my only issue with movie as it looked like high budget TV soap opera in some scenes.Don't miss on this one! You'll have fun.",Aladdin,2019-05-24,6.9,231225,2019

tt6139732,2,"I tried to like this movie but I couldn't. Disney Live Action remakes just aren't good. All the Live Action remakes are only made for money. They bank too heavily on nostalgia which I don't like. I feel that this movie should not have been made. I feel the same way about any Live Action remake that has been released or is coming out. Here are some positives. Most of the cast does a good job. Will Smith isn't trying to beat out Robin Williams as the Genie but still does a great job. The soundtrack is decent. It's still incredibly catchy but not as catchy as the original. The only song I feel that is better in this movie is Arabian Nights. All the other songs are good but not as outstanding as the original. Unfortunately, the negatives outweigh the positives. The pacing of this film is way off. It feels rushed at certain points and the end of the film starts to drag and it takes too long. It also doesn't help that this film is 38 minutes longer than the original. Marwan Kenzari is a decent actor but he didn't do a good job in this film. In my opinion, he didn't know what to do with the character. Jafar never felt like a major threat during the film which is a problem because he is the main villain. There were some changes that were made to the story but I felt they really didn't work for me. Jasmine's added character arc was a big meh for me. It felt a little out of place within the narrative. The new songs they added were meh for me. They aren't as memorable as the other songs in the film. The effects on the Genie are still as bad as they were in the trailer which was very distracting. The film is very brightly lit which makes it feel like a Disney Channel Original Film. There are also some slow motion scenes that come out of nowhere and make no sense at all.

tt6139732,1,"This remake is so bad. It is not a good movie by any means. All of the characters are ruined. In the original Aladdin was charming and charismatic, in this he's clumsy, awkward and seemingly dim witted. A scene where he fumbles through a conversation with the princess, stuttering inaudible sounds is painful to watch. The sultan, once kind hearted and jolly now controlling and not nearly as likeable. Jafar, no longer old and twisted he's young and evil for a reason that doesn't seem to be explained. Then there's Genie. I was hesitant to see this movie for this reason. I love Will Smith, but no one could ever come close to the masterpiece that Robin Williams achieves with his portrayal of Genie. Will Smith could, and should, have put his own trademark spin on the character. But unfortunately he didn't, and as a result he's very bland. The storyline doesn't help, Aladdin and Genie's friendship isn't built, it's just suddenly announced that they are friends, which just seems odd and insincere. Which pretty much sums up the acting from all he other actors. It feels fake and it feels forced, there were times I thought I was watching a high school production. The original movie deserved so much more than this. The one redeeming feature is some of the choreography, but in saying that I'm reminded of one music scene where the footage was sped up and I was left wondering why film techniques from the 1950s were being used. Very disappointed. I love the original. And that's the Aladdin I love and will keep in my heart as the right and only version.",Aladdin,2019-05-24,6.9,231225,2019

Who chose the actors? The acting was bad, Will Smith as the genie??? Everyone agrees that reenact Robin Williams would be a though task, Will Smith has done some great things but here failed completely.
Jaffar, that powerful imponent deceitful character, again, I'm sorry, Mr Kenzari wasn't up to the task.
The scenery was bad, I mean, it would be acceptable for a Sunday morning Disney channel, 8 to 10 year old audience, not for a movie theater motion picture. The singing like wise, awful, no emotion.

Speaking of fakery, even common animals like the monkey and tiger are CGI, when Hollywood has been using real, trained such animals with success in the industry for years. What's the point of a ""live action"" movie if even such common elements are unreal CGI.

This 2019 retailing stars Will Smith, Mena Masound and Naomi Scott and follows the tale of a young man named Aladdin(Massound) who meets a young woman at the marketplace unaware that she is the Princess Jasmine in incongito(Scott)and wants to win her over. With help from a charming Genie(Will Smith),Aladdin disguises himself as a Prince. But when an evil sultan named Jafar wants the lamp,can Aladdin win the Princesses heart.Now I'm not gonna lie I was so nervous watching this film as I thought Will Smith would ruin it with his singing style and the other actors,but to my surprise along with my mom and my brother,we all loved it. Will Smith was great in this film with his comedic timing,Naomi Scott was excellent as Jasmine(And boy can she sing so good). The villian was decent I thought he was different compare to the 1992 version.The cinematography was gorgeous, the music was very good especially the new song Speechless. The costumes were stunning too.I loved how it wasn't a beat by beat of the original. For instance in the One Jump Ahead song Aladdin and Jasmine meet first thing while she is in incognito and near the end Jasmine didn't say I choose you Aladdin/call me Al.Guy Richie thank you for making this film. Would definetly put it in my top 5 favourite Disney Live Action movies of all time now.

tt5727208,9,"That was INTENSE. Decided to watch this after seeing this film pop up on so many ""2019 Top 10 movies"" lists and I couldn't be happier that I did. Adam Sandler absolutely killed it in this, I kept feeling confused at the choices he made but at the same time felt sorry for him.That ending game though... my palms were sweaty and I was on the edge of my seat waiting to see if it was going to end badly like most gambling movies do. I was extremely surprised to see him win his bet thinking ""wow this movie actually is going to have a happy ending"" but oh boy was I SHOCKED when Sandler unlocked that door... my jaw was on the ground.Only thing keeping it from a 10 is the ending felt incomplete. What's his family going to think and what's his side piece gonna do once she came back to his dead corpse. Either way this movie was amazing.Edit: wow did not expect so much hate on this film after reading other reviews... not to mention it looks like users here are fishing out positive reviews and marking them all as ""non helpful"". I don't know about those bad reviewers but any movie that has me at a lost for words and a pounding heart rate for that long deserves a spot high up on my list...",Uncut Gems,2019-12-25,7.4,226745,2019

tt5727208,9,"""His character was unlikable."" ""It's too loud."" ""It's tiring/stressful to watch.""
I fail to see anything of value in any of these critiques. If anything it proves that the director got exactly the response he wanted. It was tiring and loud and stressful and even now after watching it my blood pressure is high and my neck is taught with nerves, but that's literally the point. Not every film has to center on a conventionally attractive hero progressing towards his goal after a setback and consequently fixing whatever romantic issues they had. One of the moments that made me love this film even more was Howey's attempt to reconcile with his wife at Passover. For just a moment, they roped me into believing that this could be the classic Sandler movie turning point, where he grows as a person in some way and his significant other takes him back. He didn't get this chance here and I love the director for that. Instead of the generic turn around story, we got to see a natural end to his destructive tendencies. It may not be the feel good experience you went to the movies for, but that doesn't make it bad. I think watching at home is a good choice though. I had to take a break in the middle of the film, and that likely made all the difference in my ability to enjoy it.",Uncut Gems,2019-12-25,7.4,226745,2019
tt5727208,10,"Saw this at TIFF. From front to back, this movie might be most stressful thing I've ever seen. I was a huge fan of Good Time and this movie ramps the intensity to an even higher level. Sandler's performance is great. It just shows that time after time, if he's working with a good director(s), a strong supporting cast, and an interesting concept, he will absolutely crush it. Also what other movie could have ""people watching sports"" be the most exhilarating part of the story?I also loved that the score (Daniel Lopatin aka Oneohtrix Point Never) is used super strategically to build discomfort, especially when it swells to drown out the dialogue.Looking forward to watching this again when it gets a wide release in December.",Uncut Gems,2019-12-25,7.4,226745,2019
tt5727208,10,"It has been a fascinating ride watching the numerous ups and downs of Adam Sandler's career. From classic comedies like Happy Gilmore to great dramatic performances like Reign Over Me, he has proven time and time again that he is a very talented guy. The problem is that he has let himself fall out of the spotlight over the last ten years, simply due to the fact that he has been choosing some of the worst films of each year, on multiple occasions. In what might be the greatest performance he has ever given, Uncut Gems is his latest role that will be released this fall. After viewing this at the Toronto International Film Festival and giving it a little time to sink in, I can confidently say that this will end up being one of my favourite films of 2019 by year's end.Following a jewelry store owner in Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler) as he gets his hands on a precious gemstone from Ethiopia, he decides to lend it to an NBA star in good faith. What sadly becomes apparent is the fact that he has many issues under the surface. Being a really shady figure and having a serious gambling addiction ends up giving this movie an insane amount of tension. This is a roller coaster ride of claustrophobia and I couldn't get enough of it.Directors Benny and Josh Safdie have been quietly building a solid little career for themselves. Having worked on very small indie projects like Heaven Knows What and then one of 2017s very best movies in Good Time, they're truly a duo that this industry needs. Their creativity always leaps off the screen in a way that feels very different from other filmmakers working today. This is a movie that heavily relies on pacing, editing, and performances. With a screenplay that requires nearly every performer to constantly be in motion or talking over one another, this movie barely gives you a second to catch a breath.By the time the third act begins, you'll probably wonder why you have been so invested in Sandler's portrayal of Howard because he's really not the best person. With that said, it's the fact that he is a terrible person deep down and is so greedy that is what made it so engaging and unnerving at times. With the use of periodic psychedelic imagery, a pulse-poundingly superb score, and a slew of uberly talented performers, Uncut Gems is a movie that states from the very beginning that it's a contender for the upcoming awards season.Overall, some viewers will absolutely wonder what the point of the movie was, due to the nature of how the final few minutes play out, but it was precisely these final moments that took me off guard and had me loving it even more. Personally, I feel that audiences have become impatient with films these days and anything over an hour and a half may seem like a chore to them if they're not completely on board, so that's why I would recommend this movie. It's not short, but the way this movie is put together makes it fly by. I believe this movie can be appreciated by many viewers. Uncut Gems is easily one of the years best films.",Uncut Gems,2019-12-25,7.4,226745,2019
tt5727208,8,"They should hand out high-grade blood pressure meds to people going to see this after it ends. The major strength and in a way the slight weakness of Uncut Gems is how laser-focused the Safdies are in conveying total anxiety, stress and mania through this extreme act of full cinema SOUND (levels of acting and over-lapping dialog, that Vangelis-Blade-Runner-on-Steroids/Crystal Meth score, some of the cinematography and the tracking of the camera).I do wish there was a little more than just flourishes of relief, though I'd be lying if I said Sandler was anything but exceptional and riveting playing degenerate crumbling right before our eyes. While Eric Bogosian, Lakeith Stanfield and Kevin Garnett and many others here are natural solid, it's Sandler's show, and it's soulful and tense and harrowing and ultimately (as terrible as Howard can be) tragic. The filmmakers's greatest achievement from the looks of this and Good Time is finding star-actors who aren't known for their wide range and getting career-triumph work from them. If the movie isn't all that complex, I do think Howard is and that helps make this pretty special as a depiction of addiction, more than anything else. It's got grit and style to burn, which is mostly fine by me.",Uncut Gems,2019-12-25,7.4,226745,2019
tt5727208,NA,"UNCUT GEMS (2019). First things first. This is not an ""Adam Sandler movie"". Yes, he is the star and the focus of the advertising, but, this is very much a ""Safdie Brothers film"". Emphasis on ""film"". Benny and Josh Safdie are very much in love with the look and feel of the films of the 70s and 80s, in particular. But, as with GOOD TIME, they are not interested in doing a cutesy wink-wink homage. It's in their bones.
Sandler plays Howard, New York city jeweler who's also a full-time hustler. His marriage to Dinah (Idina Menzel) is falling apart, his gambling debts are piling up and he is facing health issues. He banks his future on an Ethiopian rock which houses the title valuables. Also involved are a two-bit floozy he's carrying on with (Julia Fox) and Boston Celtics legend Kevin Garnett - playing himself.
From the get-go, the Safdie Brothers (who also co-wrote with Ronald Bonstein) bring enormous energy and drive to the proceedings. Sandler starts at 11 and goes from there. Similarly, Daniel Lopatin's score is often mixed so high it becomes intrusive at times (the synth music itself isn't bad, sort of a retro blend of Vangelis and Jean-Michel Jarre). Darius Khondij's 35mm photography is both slick and gritty.
Director Yorgos Lanthimos (THE FAVOURITE) has remarked that UNCUT GEMS is like ""a Robert Altman film that was dipped in acid."" Altman's 1974 CALIFORNIA SPLIT certainly fits the time period and some of the themes. Of course, Altman was an original and as many of his admirers have found out over the years, overlapping dialogue and naturalistic atmosphere do not alone make an ""Altman film"" (Altman himself often enough failed to create the unique mood). UNCUT GEMS works because of the filmmaking brio and Sandler's driven performance. Still, at times, it seems to be trying too hard. It works best in the last act when the Safdies let the drama play out more. It's a good film, even if not quite up to GOOD TIME. But, hey, Celtics fans now know how Boston beat Philadelphia in that 2012 Playoff series!",Uncut Gems,2019-12-25,7.4,226745,2019

But worst of all, it doesn't even matter. His character is completely unlikeable. You don't even want him to get it back. There is nothing redeemable at all about the guy. You're not rooting for him.

tt7349950,6,"It's been a while since I've read the book or seen the first movie; so I apologize if I get some things wrong.TLDR; The film drags on in the middle by splitting up the crew and subjecting them to meaningless jump scares. This means little character interaction (which is part of what the first movie had going for it). By the time you get to the final confrontation with Pennywise, you're just tired of the jump scares and want it to be over because you're not really rooting for the losers. And if you are, it's mostly because of what was established in the first film.Pros:
The film starts off great. Somehow the scene at the bridge manages to match the iconic opening scene of the first.Skarsgård is an amazing Pennywise and is creepy as hell.Stan's speech in Richie's second flashback is great and actually funny.Casting is, for the most part, really good. I think it was hard for some of the adult actors to find a balance between being recognizable while still showing how they've matured over time. Adult Richie is too kid-like while Bev is too mature to the point of being unrecognizable.Cons:
Bowers is half-assed. Literally just used for three jump scares and nothing else. Either imply that he died and leave him out or fully use him like he is in the book as the epitome of the corruption in Derry.The final form of Pennywise is unsatisfying. It's literally a clown torso on some sort of arachnid body. They needed to go full arachnid alien like it is in the book. I think this part is just difficult to translate from the book though.Stan's letter at the end cheapens his death. Instead of him literally being unable to handle his fear of IT, his suicide is portrayed as a sacrifice to save the others.There's next to no character development and very little meaningful interaction between characters. I blame this mostly on the middle 90 minutes where they all split up. It's totally different from the first film where they are actually a team.Speaking of which, this part where they all go their separate ways to find their ""tokens"" is so contrived. The story literally loses all its steam due to this and makes it feel way too long.All of the monster scenes except the ones with Pennywise have terrible CGI. They might be gross and/or startling but you can see them coming and they don't contribute much.About 1/3 to 1/2 of the jokes just kinda fell flat.The constant jump scenes and long running time just make this movie exhausting to watch. It was just a constant cycle of ""pan to character, give a little backstory, jump scare, repeat"".",It Chapter Two,2019-09-06,6.5,211047,2019

As a huge fan of the original mini-series (and EVERYTHING Tim Curry), I knew I'd have a challenge going into both Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 with an open mind. I had to separate. I didn't have as high of expectations as I did for Chapter 1 as Part 2 of the mini series was much weaker than the Part 1 anyway as well as Stephen King's It (Book).The actors were great. Even the first few jump scares were decent, and then it just became overkill. And not scary whatsoever. All of the CGI monsters look ridiculous and completely take you out of the moment. I grew up watching 80s/90s horror (AND LOVING IT). The baddies were REAL and TERRIFYING. For example, Mrs. Massey, the bloated bathtub corpse in The Shining. That was a real, completely horrifying image that has stayed with me 30 years after I First saw the movie.

IT - the movie, this movie - is a cheap zombie movie stuffed with special effects and CGI with the sole purpose of jump-scaring the audience. There is no narrative, no storytelling, nothing more than a random - and awfully long - sequence of third league horror vignettes.

Should you be allowed to leave reviews if your taste in movies is that bad?! Some poor sod might read your review and go see this movie...do you not feel any guilt!This was AWFUL! Its not even worth constructing proper sentences for so I'll leave these points here:1. The terrible acting. It was awful. The actors were either bored or overacting (Bill, Mike, Richie). Seriously terrible.2. What on earth was the need to make this a 3 hour movie?! It was so unnecessarily dragged out and incredibly boring3. The story had no story. Mike tells them there's an Indian ritual they must collect artefacts for which separates them all for 2 hours of the movie but then it turns out there was no ritual...WHAT?! What was the point of that?! Ben threw into the fire something he'd held dear in his wallet for 27 years for...no.....reason??4. Seperating the characters like that and filling the scenes with flashbacks made sure there was no character development5. Erm what happened to Bills wife? Bev is kissing all the guys but is still married. They turned Bev's character into a gold digging floozy by having her kiss Bill then choose the wealthy and better looking Ben for his boat?!6. What in the name of all that is Mike Myers was that terrible CGI about?! The old granny scene in the original was scary as she was a creepy old lady not a 15 foot naked zombie like monster7. Speaking of zombies...Bowers zombie friend drives cars and breaks him out of an asylum? If zombies can do that, why did Pennywise need Bowers?8. Speaking of Bowers...what was the point of him in all his over acting melodrama? He did nothing. Except to prove you can be stabbed in the heart and walk away absolutely fine9. Stanley's suicide notes to each and every one of them that he wrote and posted before killing himself?! The act was supposed to have been done out of pure fear...not as a human sacrifice10. The grand finale. After spending 2 hours looking for tokens and Mike carrying around a badly built dustbin made in a beginner's pottery class, turns out all you had to do was hurt Pennywises feelings by calling him a clown and he will turn into a baby?

He was in it but they spent so much time soul searching the past of the characters that the real present stuff went lacking. Needless to say the first remake is an all time favorite.

This movie is just a long run of jumpscares (all the f'ing time), not at all scary CGI monsters and reusing of the same jokes and ""scares"". I don't think the director has used a single practical effect in this picture.There is no tension or character-investing in this movie, and the director manages to make the cast (who works with What they have been giving) look terrible in their acting. It is not scary, just very, very annoying and does not live up to either the book, the mini-tv series or part 1 of the reboot from 2017 (even though it also was an CGI orgy).If you like a horror movie, where you don't need a build of tension or the director sticking to a plot or giving the audience a decent payout, but just adds a lot of jumpscares for almost 3 hours - You will love this..

tt7349950,6,"""For 27 years, I dreamt of you. I craved you. I've missed you!""Pros:The casting director very much shines in the spotlight here. If there is a category for Best Casting Director in the Academy Award, I am all in to bet that It: Chapter Two's will not just get nominated, but win very big. The casting director deserves a standing ovation for choosing the right actors for the right characters that resemble a lot with the younger-selves from the predecessor.You will feel the emotional impact of The Losers' Club as a whole. The fear that feeds their souls, the memories that hunt them & the hopeless feeling that manipulates their strength all leave a strong impression to wonder within & about.The various & disparate forms of IT should give a blast of excitement to the audience. This is the most entertaining part of the movie where you get to watch new other-worldly creatures lingering within the shadows or the old monsters are back to haunt them with a peek-a-boo! It is gross, weird and definitely strange.The heartwarming story of The Losers' Club friendship is the beautiful gem you will find in no other horror movies this year. The connection they have is so strong and palpable,An excellent set of transition techniques that jump from one place to another, giving that ominous vibe and at the same time feels like an adventure.Cons:Albeit the creatures are entertaining to watch, however it lacks the manifestation of the scary rituals that should follow. This is the main problem with the IT movies, it is not terrifying nor scary enough to make you have a nightmare. Even sometimes it is laughable due to its unprecedented nature of the creatures' features.The real form of IT is upsetting and disappointing. I can strongly say that the majority will love IT's true form from the 1990 Television Mini-Series in comparison to the remake because that looks scarier, deadlier & more realistic.It is super slow and draggy that it doesn't need to be at almost 3 hours mark. 2 hours should be the best run time for this movie like IT Chapter One. It has nothing much to talk about especially during the first hour. Reunion, get together, a few jumpscare parts. That's all there is to it.The second act of the movie (halfway) feels as if you are watching 5 to 6 different short films instead. Because it has that slow-burning nature, the scenes feel disjointed from one another. It spends around 45 minutes to an hour to look at every members of The Losers' Club being haunted by Pennywise.Verdict: IT CHAPTER TWO is certainly fresh and enjoyable. Hopes up not, its extremely slow-going story may make the audience bore enough to put you into sleep mode.

tt7349950,2,"After seeing Chapter One I expected so much more, unfortunately IT didn't deliver. The film starts out with an overly graphic bashing scene that tries hard to be topical but instead seems to be there just to dare you to criticize it's honesty. And things just go downhill from there. The Loser's Club of the first film reunites 27 years later to have another go at defeating Pennywise, but where the kids were charming and you wanted to root for them, the adults all go separate ways to have their own jump scene moments through an overly long two hour middle section of the film. The film bogs because it keeps showing flashbacks to when they were kids instead of building the characters as adults. The effect is that you never really care about them as adults, they're just an excuse to show CGI monsters that never really scare you on any level. The pacing of the film is so roughshod that it never lets any suspense build as it jumps from one scene to the next, while you keep checking your watch wondering how much more of this you'll have to endure. The middle becomes a bit of a horror film mish mash with an homage to John Carpenter's The Thing (verbatim quote and all) a little bit of Toy Story erector spider, a dash of Poltergeist's Native American mumbo jumbo added in with a couple of million years old space entity tossed in in case you needed something to understand what they're up against. James McAvoy's character is jokingly referred to as an author whose book endings suck (a nod to the book) and unfortunately this film doesn't improve on the novel.

Lots of jumpscares, all so predictable, I was so bored, I thought: oh please, not another one. And why do they always feel the need to change the plot? For instance the one about Bill not being really sick? Why do filmmakers think they know it better than Stephen King? Or steal from other movies (the Thing) And the end, the end, that was the last straw for me. If you read the book you know what IT really looks like.

tt7349950,3,"'IT chapter 2' is a film based on the Steven King's novels, that was released on screen in order to express the horror that the evil clown exposed in the old town of Derry. The direction is poor, seems like they didn't even try to make it scary or post the image that this story was supposed to show. I remember a scene in the theater where I would laugh to those small babyheaded spiders. The cast looked like they were bored every minute of it, being there just for the title of the film and the publicity it had gained. They did not make any try to act, just reading words and acting accordingly like anybody could do it. The story had some interest but it was all sunk with the terrible acting and directing and at some point took the downroad for good as it seemed like they made it something up to fill it up as they were running out of time. There were many points during the film where I was annoyed, even bored, ready to sleep on my chair, the duration of the film was inexcusable like there were added extra nonsense minutes to it. To sum it up, 'IT chapter 2' is a movie for young kids aged 10 - 14 because they would be the only ones to appreciate it.

Jessica Chastain mailed it in. Bill Hader echoing F-bombs every other word. Ransome is a guy you want to punch. The only scene I enjoyed in the film was the scene with the old woman-and even that was ruined because the entire scene played out in the trailer. Worst, the movie wasn't even scary. CGI trickery.

tt7349950,1,"Look, I don't mind being entertained at the movies, but there does come the expectation with such an adaptation of one of the best and most beloved horror novels ever written that it accord some respect while remaining true to the source material.My main problem with this film lies in its tonal inconsistency. I could never tell if it was attempting to set a somber, foreboding, menacing feeling, or if it was trying to create an atmosphere conducive towards a lighthearted, hilarious jump-scare filled marathon. In one moment it hangs heavy in emotional gravitas (the opening scene is especially brutal and difficult to watch, and Stanley's suicide is also fairly dark), and the next, it's so ludicrously over the top and in your face in its execution of its ""horror"" elements that it produces a jarring sense of tonal discord. What exactly is this film attempting to be? The horror was so absurdly explicitly comedic in its execution (not helped by questionable effects work) that I must assume that was the intent. Yet in taking such a directorial approach, it effectively nullified the entire foundation that the movie required to establish and help foment the dreadful tension, atmosphere, and tone necessitated by the narrative (and of which made the book so stellar), and further relegated all the work by the actors and all other aspects of the film that had helped establish it up to that point void. If it wasn't intentional, then it does nothing so well as to exemplify how the filmmakers hold a fundamental misunderstanding of what actual horror really entails.""IT Chapter Two"" spends much of its runtime plodding through a mindless, rote, predictable checklist of the characters recovering their artifacts from their youths, to the same tired, mindless, rote, predictable jump scares thrown at you one after the other which you can see coming from a million miles off which further robbed them of all their potency. How am I supposed to care at all about the protagonists' emotional plights (which are portrayed in a serious light) when their antagonist and its supposedly evil forms who are responsible for them are utterly stripped of their malevolence and are portrayed in such a formulaic, repetitive, explicit, and laughably juvenile manner? Yes, I know ""IT"" manifests itself also as a Pennywise who does utilize a childlike humor to lure his prey in, but that doesn't mean it wasn't the only way nor that the entity wasn't terrifying in all the revelations of its truest forms. They were terrifying in the novel, and here they're a downright riot. A little subtlety, suggestion, imagination, minimalism and unpredictability goes a long way and would've done this film wonders, as that's where the real core of any effective horror resides. It would've not only have helped maintain tonal consistency, it would've made it genuinely unsettling. My theatre was howling at every turn, and I'm completely left at a loss as to whether that was what the director intended.As is, this film suffers an identity crisis. It is inconsistent, predictable, ludicrously (and unintentionally?) hilarious, redundant, overly drawn out to the point of boredom, and worst of all, a downright insult to King, who I'm shocked made the cameo he did in tacit approval of this screen adaptation abomination of his finest work. The glaring tonal juxtaposition and abysmal execution robbed me of all interest in witnessing The Losers' Club finally confront this ultimate evil terrorizing a small Maine town every 27 years, because in the end, it wasn't an ultimate evil at all......it was a goddamn mockery of one.And due to that, I walked out. Truly, truly awful.",It Chapter Two,2019-09-06,6.5,211047,2019
tt7349950,5,"I was very excited to see this film, have been since 2017, when I saw the first one. Unfortunately, this one was a huge mess.I love the way the first IT didn't want to be JUST a horror movie, but rather took time to build up a story, emotional connection. That is what made it so different from all the other horror movies that are being made nowadays. HOWEVER, this was completely thrown out the window in the second one. Considering how incredibly long this movie is, 90% of it was just buildup for jumpscares, jumpscares themselves and weird CGI.The worst thing for me was that there were too many things going on, jumping all over the place. And most of it was just for shock value, nothing important to the story.What I did love was the casting, it was absolutely brilliant, especially Eddie.I guess this is once again a classic case of - bigger budget does not mean better movie, as well as more CGI does not mean better movie.",It Chapter Two,2019-09-06,6.5,211047,2019
tt7349950,6,"IT chapter 2 isn't a very good movie, but itisn't terrible either. I am a big fan of both the book and the mini-series, so I may have gone in a bit biased. But where I really liked chapter 1, I just didn't feel it for chapter 2.The acting is great, but somehow I wasn't invested in any of the characters. They were just that: characters.I was pleasantly surprised the movie opened with the Adrian Melon scene. This scene is one that makes the story of IT (and many other stories of mr. King) so great: besides the obvious evil of Pennywise, there are also ""real"" threats, like homophobic villagers.I was very disappointed in the fact the storyline of Beverly's husband was completely cut, and the storyline of Henry Bowers was butchered. The fact that the Losers weren't only fighting Pennywise, but also had to dodge attacks from real people (so more rational fears if you will) was what made the book and the mini-series better than this flick.All in all, it was an ""okay"" movie. Not great, not terrible, just ""meh"".",It Chapter Two,2019-09-06,6.5,211047,2019
tt1979376,9,"As far as conclusions to beloved franchises go, Toy Story 3 is hard to beat. The film tugs at the heartstrings, as we learn that Andy's toys are no longer his, and cuts deep with the realisation that growing up means letting go.Naturally, I had a lot of trepidation heading into Toy Story 4. It wasn't so much about whether the film would be good or not, as Pixar have been pretty reliable in that regard. Rather it was about whether, despite the best efforts from everyone involved, Toy Story 4 would be able to shake off feeling unnecessary. Well, I'm happy to report that not only is Toy Story 4 a triumph, but the film's heartfelt finale feels like a proper send-off for Woody and his friends and proves that it was a story that needed to be told.The best way to summarise is that Toy Story 3 is the end of Andy's story, while Toy Story 4 is (likely) the end of the toys' story.While essentially a roadtrip film, the story focuses on the toys finding their place in the outside world for the first time and it's hard not to draw the analogy between young adults moving out of home. The film captures the feeling of uncertainty but also the new found possibility that leaving a place of comfort entails and it's a joy to see the series mature along with the kids who first watched Toy Story back in 1995.It is also, undoubtedly, the funniest Toy Story film, largely due to a bevy of hilarious new supporting characters. Forky is a definite highlight while Keanu Reeves steals his scenes as Duke Caboom and Key and Peele bring their expert comedic timing to a pair of carnival-prize plush toys who are attached together by their hands but bounce off each other like rubber balls.Thanks to a consistently funny script, the film is a blast to watch when it's not making your eyes well up, but either way the film will likely leave you crying. If you're still skeptical about the film, let me just say that, nine years may have passed between sequels, but the series' heart is beating as strong as ever.",Toy Story 4,2019-06-21,7.8,207464,2019
tt1979376,6,"While children growing up and losing interest in their toys is a natural part of life, I really think that Pixar should consider one last sequel and end this epic franchise on a happier note.Children who have followed this story from the very beginning were probably devastated about the parting of woody and buzz.Of course it's just my opinion, but wouldn't it be nice if Andy, years later, all grown up and with a family of his own, decided to seek out and try to find all his childhood friends. Or even just stumbles upon them one by one. Have it end with all the toys reunited in Andy's home with Andy's children. Basically ending with it coming full circle.Children could then imagine all the toys happy, together, forever. To infinity and beyond.",Toy Story 4,2019-06-21,7.8,207464,2019
tt1979376,2,"The picture is amazing! Really one of the most beautiful animations I've seen yet. The story however was boring and disappointing, when comparing it to the previous films.In a previous Toy Story Buzz says: ""The important thing is that we stick together"". - in Toy Story 4 Buzz loses all his previous personality. He listens to his ""conscious?"" Seriously? It was funny and very concrete thinking as Buzz often can be at times. But let's not forget who Buzz was in previous films. He began as believing he truly was a space ranger. When he finally comes out of that he realizes he's not a ranger but a toy. When he finally figures out his importance and value in his family of toys, he becomes as loyal and committed to Andy and the rest of the group as Woody is. Together they get rid of Sid, fly to the van, and conquer all sorts of missions in the next movies. Buzz takes the lead in toy story 2 to help track down and save woody. But in Toy story 4 it's like he's a drone. All he can do is listen to his little toy commands. He's straight up clueless in this film. At one point he actually abandons woody at the antique shop when the odds were highly against them, because his push button told him to??? Really? That's not the buzz we know and love!! The buzz we knew almost died with Woody in a furnace! He would go to the ends of the earth for his buddies. They were a team and a family. But not anymore. Now Buzz is a drone with little thoughts for himself anymore. He does whatever his buttons tell him to. ""Goodbye Woody, sorry if you die in the antique shop, but my conscious told me to quit"". That's all it took? Really? Ok?Woody was a fearless leader in all three movies. Until this one. Yes he still had a heart of gold. But, he went from Bo Peeps hero and Sharif that she looked up to, to his whipping boy. She straight up tells him at one point that he's essentially stupid and doesn't know what he's doing and needs to get in line and follow her. Really? Woody went from her hero to her little
Boy. He literally follows her around apologizing with his tail tucked between his legs. Goodbye Woody, it was nice knowing you... now you're this wimpy cowboy doll who lets all the girls beat the crap out of you and basically tell you, you're worthless - you aren't played with anymore (you stick to the closet while the cowgirl is the new sheriff in town), another doll unapologetically rips your pull string out, because she feels this is the only way to get her own worth - so you just turn over and take the abuse, the love of your life says your basically washed up and need to follow her lead because of how stupid you are. This is not how I imagined Woody going out of the franchise.If only the Gabby doll would have showed an ounce of remorse for what she did to woody, it would have driven home the sacrifice he made for her to allow her to take his pill string and start a new life of her own. No, the villain takes what she wants and never shows a bit of gratitude to woody.These new carnival characters feel like they were pulled out of the new pets movie. They had some great comic relief at points, but felt like they were in the wrong movie. They felt really out of place.The kaboom guy was another completely random and useless character. It felt like he was another insert to try to make people laugh, as though that was his only purpose for the film.We never get to see bulls eye, Rex, and the rest of the gang. They literally were extras in this film unlike the other three movies.Forky was a creative spin on things and added some great comedy. But, really the emotional connection to the characters we poorly done in this film. I was literally bored and just waiting for the next thing to happen. I didn't care about the end clips when the credits rolled. This story was so weak.It was a poor way to say goodbye to our beloved characters. We didn't even really get to say goodbye to most of them, they were hiding in the RV the whole time.I thought this would be a tear jerker, but I don't really care that Woody is not a part of the gang anymore. They took away all the elements that bonded these characters together in the first place.The franchise should have ended at 3.",Toy Story 4,2019-06-21,7.8,207464,2019
tt1979376,10,"I've been watching, and rewatching all of the Toy Story films for years now and have loved them all, and never wanted them to end, because I could never see an end to such a beloved series of films, but everything eventually has to finish out, and Toy Story 4 does it beautifully. I'm a guy who usually doesn't cry in movie theatres, heck it's a rare sight to see me crying, but I was bawling at the end. They did leave it to make other films, which I hope that they do, but if they left it like this I wouldn't be sad, because it closed all the emotional doors that needed to be closed, for me personally, and even opened some I had never knew could open before. Highly recommend 10/10.",Toy Story 4,2019-06-21,7.8,207464,2019
tt1979376,1,"Well...I prefer considering ""Toy story 4"" as a side story that someone, who doesn't know anything about the characters, made just for fun. As a big fan of Toy Story for years I was very disappointed with the whole plot. First , our beloved characters like Jessie, Bullseye, Rex , Ham, Mr and Mrs Potato Head, Slinky Dog and Little Aliens almost got no screen time. Buzz barely got some time and even then it made him look dumb and as if he wasn't so serious about finding Woody. And all these happened for the shake of the new toys,who were interesting and sometimes funny, but it wasn't necessary to see them all the time. Something else I want to mention is that if you know the original characters, you know it's impossible for them to just sit in a van and do nothing to help their friend who needs them. I don't think finding Bo Beep again and giving her all the screentime was a positive thing as she was nothing special from the beginning. Also Bonnie suddenly loving a fork more than the toys she promised to take care of, shows than she never really deserved to have them! Yes, it was fine that in Toy Story 3 the whole gang ended up at a new home that someone would play with them again, even though it was a big change. Because of that I had a hope that it may end like this, happily starting a new life with a nice new kid that will take care of them,but no...Toy Story 4 came to give us a depressing plot twist and, in my opinion, a terrible end for Woody. Separating the gang for whatever reason is so heartbreaking for a fan who heard the news about Toy Story 4 and was excited to watch it. Especially for a reason that doesn't represent Woody's personality and values. In conclusion, a movie good for kids and anyone who haven't heard about the original Toy Story.",Toy Story 4,2019-06-21,7.8,207464,2019
tt1979376,6,Definitely they should stop with the third movie. They separated buzz and wood. Bonnie is the real villain (?).,Toy Story 4,2019-06-21,7.8,207464,2019
tt1979376,1,The film felt like a quick money grab. The characters developed over the last 20 years were cast aside with the majority limited to one line. Woody flip flops between his morals and the ending was incredibly disappointing. Toy story 3 wrapped the series up superbly and it should have been left there.,Toy Story 4,2019-06-21,7.8,207464,2019
tt1979376,1,"Toy Story has become an integral part of our lives. It reels us all back into childhood and keeps our innocence alive. Toy Story has had the privilege of taking us all on that journey. Sadly, Toy Story 4 has brought our childlike innocence to a screeching halt.Although, it really goes without saying, the toys should have never been given away to Bonnie. To keep the nostalgia alive, in Toy Story 3, Andy could have kept his toys in the attic. The ending could have shown glimpses of Andy getting married and having children. The ending of part 3 could have very easily been bittersweet to see Andy's toys given to his own children and Woody and Buzz's legacy of faithfulness to Andy's children continue.Toy Story 4 felt like a slap in the face to not only all the fans of Toy Story, but the hope that this film brought with it. The main charachter really focuses on solely Woody, which becomes apparent by the end of the film. In no way is this taking away from the laughs the film brought, because it is quite amusing. The plot felt scattered and pointless. As an adult whom had favorite toys saved in the attic for the my children,Toy Story 4 was a huge disappointment. ""Gabby Gabby's"" character felt quite selfish. In leaving Woody in the condition that they left him in didn't feel selfless; it felt robbed of his loyalty. Although the stuffed bunny and chick were funny, their characters felt like Pixar was looking for ways to find laughs. Finding ""Bo Peep"" as a conclusion to the story was not a good enough reason to create Toy Story 4.A sad misstep in Toy Story's legacy.

tt1979376,1,"I love Toy story. It probably is one of my all time favourites. I was lucky even enough to have an original buzz light year toy, So obviously when I found out toy story 4 was being released I couldn't wait. I love all Disney. But it was good to know that I could watch a film that wasn't a remake. I could go into this film feeling like I did when I watched Toy story for the first time.I wanted to like this film so much. And don't get me wrong the animation was beautiful. The first scene was brilliant. It felt like the good old days. And I was hopeful for the rest of the film. But unfortunately this film just didn't sit right.One huge problem for me is that it wasn't believable. Woody was being forgotten about and being left at the back of the closet. But Toy story 3 would have you believe that Bonnie loved Woody and after the heartbreak of watching Andy give him to her at the end, was okay because you thought she would love him just as much.Second of all. I know that it's all about the kid. But it isn't. It's about the toys friendship. Leave no you behind. So why would Woody choose to leave all his friends. It just doesn't make sense. The whole set up for this film from the beginning was to make you feel comfortable with woody leaving. But it's just not in his character.All our favourites Slinky, rex, Hamm, bullseye, Jessie to name a few got next to no screen time. Buzz got some but still not enough! He was almost made to come across as an idiot. For what, some cheap laughs.This film was scary the dummy's were nightmare worthy but the actual protagonist just wasn't deep enough. No where near Sid, Stinky Pete or lotso. Probably so you could like her and be happy she found her kid. It just felt far too forced for me.Overall I wish this film didn't exist. Watching the RV drive away made me honestly feel heart broken. I felt as if I truly had lost someone important. And how would Andy feel knowing that the Toy he so dearly loved, the Toy he entrusted to Bonnie was now lost.Toy story should have ended with 3 or at the very least Woody should have been taken to college with Andy where he would have been Loved.",Toy Story 4,2019-06-21,7.8,207464,2019
tt1979376,1,"I knew there was absolutely no way they could do a better ending than Toy Story 3. Toy Story 4 was disappointing, really disappointing. It was eerie, dark, and lacked all the heart of the first 3. It completely contradicts the underlying theme of the first 3 movies and throws it into a 180, leaving us with a sad, lackluster, way too ""hey, kids- reality's not easy"" ending. According to this latest installment;
1.) You don't have a friend in me.
2.) Whatever life throws at you, it's not going to be okay because you can't count on your friends & family to be there for you to infinity and beyond.So many elements to this movie were just flat out depressing. Woody is trapped, defeated and dismembered, being robbed of his voice box and yet, we're supposed to somehow completely be ok with that because the eerie attacker is the one who the story writers want to aim sympathy toward (??!) The other horribly depressing part of this story is Buzz Lightyear is reduced to a brainless sideshow coward who has somehow lost his heroic persona. Also, Bo Peep is so cold with zero emotion!A seriously contradictory and downright depressing ""final chapter"" to what used to be one of the finest kid movies American pop culture ever had. Completely void of charm and heart. So bad!",Toy Story 4,2019-06-21,7.8,207464,2019
tt1979376,5,"Now before I get started I've got to make it clear that I'm one of the biggest Toy Story fans out there. In particular the moving nature of the third instalment genuinely brought me to tears as I'm sure it did with a lot of you all.While I had major concerns about the 4th movie's existence in general, I was willing to give it a shot. And don't get me wrong while Toy Story 4 is certainly not a bad movie, it's also not something that will sit in the hearts and minds of this generation any longer than a brief passing moment.The problems start with the randomness of the plot, and the amount of themes that it is trying to cover in one movie. Is it primarily about getting Forky home to Bonnie, about Woody finding Bo, about Gabby finding an owner or about something else entirely? None of it is made particularly clear to the audience.The beauty of the first 3 movies were that they had a clearly defined main plot: Toy Story was about the battle between Buzz/Woody and getting back to Andy from Sid; Toy Story 2 was about getting Woody back to Andy, and Toy Story 3 was about escaping the day care centre. Unfortunately in Toy Story 4, an actual coherent main plot is removed in favour of action sequences, the favouring of new characters instead of beloved old ones along a few amusing gags here and there.Toy Story 4 remains unsure what it wants to ultimately be about and I guess that blurred vision comes from the variety of 8 (yes 8!) screenwriters who are credited for their input into the story. Regulars such as Jessie, Rex, Hamm, Bullseye, Slinky Dog and the Potato Head are all given next to no screentime which is a massive disappointment. Keeping them in the van for most of the movie is a lazy and ultimately boring decision for many of these beloved characters who each found much better things to do in Toy Story 2 and 3 in particular.Instead the barrage of new characters makes things far too confusing for the audience. The movie needed to be about Forky or Bo - not both. There wasn't any tension in finding Bo nor was there any in getting Forky back to Bonnie. A more wild-cap adventure separating Woody and Forky from the gang and finding Bo at the very end of the film might have had a better pay off but unfortunately neither mean all that much to the audience given the other issue of spending so long at the Antique Store.Meanwhile another huge part of the movie - Buzz is a shell of his former self. He has precious little to do that actually affects the plot and really needed to be in more actual danger and peril or more useful in saying Woody and Forky.Finally put, everything just feels so low-stake compared to the first few films. There's no fear of being incinerated, getting trapped on a plane to Japan or being torn apart by a crazed kid. Instead it's just all a bit simplistic and the film lacks any real dramatic tension. Perhaps they needed to make Gabby more evil before her transformation? Or use the height of the ferris wheel for a bigger finale at the top somehow? It all just felt too warm and fuzzy and lacked the energy of all the films that have come before it.Yes this movie still has its moments - Duke Caboom is an amusing and welcome addition, Forky is a very likeable addition too and the ending was a nice send off - but unfortunately the setups all seemed too rushed that it didn't have the emotion it ultimately should of. I think by having too many writers the ultimate vision for this film got lost and the movie is all the poorer for it, which is a real shame!Kids will still like it and you'll find a few laughs, but this is certainly a step down from the original 3 films.",Toy Story 4,2019-06-21,7.8,207464,2019
tt1979376,1,"Toy Story - 1, 2 and 3 were all amazing. It's hard not to tear up at the end of 3 which was the perfect ending to (arguably) Pixar's best franchise. This film completely ruins Toy Story's legacy. It didn't take long for me to realise this film wasn't going to be good and that it's only purpose was to make more money of a beloved franchise. The story is forgettable, all of the new characters are either uninteresting or underdeveloped and almost all of the original toys are dismissed and barely in the movie. This felt like a direct to dvd sequel and I'm going to pretend that it isn't the official end to the series. I'm not going to spoil the ending but all you need to know is that it's completely unsatisfying. I'll admit, I felt emotional at the end. I felt very sad. But not because the movie was moving me, I was sad because of how disappointing the ending was and that this is the official ending no matter what I think. I'd advise you to skip this movie and let Toy Story 3 be your final memory of Toy Story instead.",Toy Story 4,2019-06-21,7.8,207464,2019

It just does not have the same charm. The story was just terrible. It was about rescuing a spork that was made from trash. They added in too many new characters. We barely got to see any of our beloved characters, jesse, bullseye, ham, rex, the potato heads, Etc. And the ending was the worst of all... why would Woody ever leave his friends that he loves? Seemed very out of character. I mean the whole reason he didn't go to the toy museum in 2 was because he didn't want to leave his friends. Anyway there was a few funny parts but I'm just going to pretend this movie never happened.",Toy Story 4,2019-06-21,7.8,207464,2019
tt1979376,10,"The announcement of a fourth Toy Story chapter, felt like an easy cash grab for Disney, after the huge success that was the concluding Toy Story 3. After seeing the first trailer and synopsis, I still wasn't sure if this was gonna work. So being a bit cautious of seeing these beloved characters coming back nine years after we said goodbye to Andy, I can say - no need to be afraid. The toys are dusted off and look better than ever!The film opens with a flashback to a rainy night where our toys are still happily living with Andy. Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) and Bo Peep (Annie Potts) are getting ready to rescue RC-racer - a radio-controlled toy car - that's been stuck in a gutter and is about to be dragged into the sewers, if not saved in time. This is an exciting opening to get you right into the story and remind you of the bond these toys have with each other. ""No toy gets left behind"", like Woody would say multiple times throughout this franchise. This scene also shows how close Woody and Bo's relationship just was, which gets torn apart moments later when the lamp that houses her and her sheep is given away.Almost a decade later, after Andy has passed his beloved toys to young Bonnie, we see her playing with all of them, although Woody gets pushed aside more often as time passes. He gets left in the closet with some of her baby toys. But when Bonnie has to attend her orientation day for kindergarten, Woody sees an opportunity to sneak into her backpack to look after the nervous girl. In class, a selfish kid grabs Bonnie's art supplies and drops some in a bin, where Woody jumps in to save some of it - along with bits of rubbish - which leads to Bonnie creating Forky (soon discovered to be a toy, voiced by Tony Hale), a spork with popsicle-stick feet, googly eyes and pipe-cleaner arms. The family has a new member.Bonnie adores Forky, but having an existential crisis, this spork knows it's trash and feels like his only destination is the trash can, his safe haven. Woody, so longing for a purpose, takes it upon himself to keep rescuing and returning Forky, which will only get harder when Bonnie and her parents embark on a road trip in an RV. A journey on which we will meet carnival toys (Ducky and Bunny - voiced by Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele), a Canadian stunt-motocross action figure (Keanu Reeves as Duke Caboom - the coolest and most breathtaking toy ever created) and a manipulative vintage doll (Christina Hendricks as Gabby Gabby) who's stuck living in an antique store, ready to do whatever's needed to live a blissful life.
The emotions run high, with stunning animation and imagery all around. New characters that will win over your heart and make you laugh out loud with the funniest one liners. Did I really expect anything less, after three exceptionally strong films in this franchise?! Shame on me.Toy Story 4 is an adventure full of subtle messages and metaphors, that carries on the legacy of its original trilogy. Disney/Pixar has done it again - a sequel that not only works as an ending, but also as a new beginning. When we get to chapter 5 (because let's be real, this is gonna kill it at the worldwide box office), these characters will have seen so much more than just the walls of Andy/Bonnie's room and have experienced what ""letting go"" really means.",Toy Story 4,2019-06-21,7.8,207464,2019
tt1979376,3,"Watching Toy Story 4 provided a similar experience to viewing last year's Incredibles 2. In the darkness of the theater I appreciated elements in both movies, but in the light of day upon further reflection afterward, I found many discrepancies and disappointments with both films. The main difference between the projects, however, was that Toy Story 4 made me angry.
In many ways, the teaser trailer was accurate: the arrival of Forky, a good idea with a bland execution, singlehandedly derails the series in a weak plot that seems fit for an extended short more than a feature film.
Bo Peep may have been Woody's love interest in the first film, but she was also quick to switch allegiances to Buzz when he wowed the toys with his gadgets and abilities, declaring ""I've found my moving buddy"" when the space toy enters the scene. (She ironically calls Buzz her moving buddy in this film also.) Beginning the fourth movie with a touching moment of Woody and Bo Peep saying goodbye was to set up the later story arc, but it falls short and feels disingenuous. Perhaps years of being on her own, away from the toys in Andy's house may have hardened her, turning her into a badass, but it doesn't ring true. Instead it feels like a set-up to make sure she fits the Disney mold of how strong women characters behave. The audience is also left to wonder how in the world she changed out of a porcelain dress. Was the switch to pants one of the ingredients needed to complete her badass makeover? I don't see her character making such a drastic change. As in life, women in films can still be strong while preserving a less in-your-face demeanor.
The movie's main conflict is based upon weak premises. Buzz Lightyear's unexplained character metamorphosis is disquieting. While the ensemble approach worked well with the previous films in the series, Toy Story 4 is too focused on introducing new characters while relegating the ones we already love to the back of the RV. The villain, Gabby Gabby, while given sympathetic motivations, was clumsily written. This didn't feel like a Toy Story movie overall.
The part that completely ruined it, though, was the ending, which was telegraphed but not motivated. Not only was it predictable based on the trailer and comments from Tom Hanks and Tim Allen about the last scene, but Woody's leaving everything behind feels completely out of character. It's a regress of his arc from all the previous Toy Story movies. How is his leaving the gang to be with Bo different from leaving the gang to be with Andy in college? After all, the arc in that film was all about letting go. Why does suddenly not being Bonnie's favorite compel him to leave her behind? After all, doesn't he have her name on his boot? How is staying with Bo different from going to Tokyo with the Roundup Gang if his kidnaping had been delayed by ten years? Acting on selfish impulse goes against Woody's core character and beliefs. What's worse, the rest of the gang freely let him go when in actuality, they would have insisted he stay like they've done in the past, while asking Bo to join them. Won't Andy be upset if he finds out that Bonnie lost Woody, especially since he was hesitant to give him up? After all, Andy asks Bonnie to look after his toys for him; he doesn't give them to her outright.
Also, the mid-credits scenes basically reduce Woody to a common criminal, which not only teaches a horrible moral lesson but goes against his principles. When Woody meted out justice in Toy Story 2 and 3, he did it to great effect and only because the other toys (Stinky Pete and Lotso) had it coming as payback for how they had behaved against all of them. The retribution was not because of a personal offense against Woody himself. What did that poor carnival worker ever do to him? Woody hadn't even known about Buzz getting tied up at the carnival, so there's no reason for him to act so heartlessly. And it is hard to miss the irony that his motive in giving away so many of the carnival game's toys was to make sure they were each given a chance to be adopted and loved by a child, the motive that had kept him with Andy, and later with Bonnie, all along.
The scene of Woody leaving was too rushed and felt clumsy. The way Bonnie's parents drove their RV to be in position for it to take place strained credulity in a movie that had already asked viewers to do so on previous occasions. (Just how long would it take a 12-inch tall doll to walk more than 5 miles?) Even if the writers were going for the romantic angle, it did not ring true, since Woody and Bo's reaction upon finding one another again was no more than cordial. Honestly, if it ended with Buzz and Jessie going off on their own for some reason, that would make a little more sense, because Toy Story 3 established their strong romantic connection. Woody's letting go of Bo would have been a much better ending. Some people predicted from the trailer that Bo would become a villain, but even though she officially doesn't, she appears darkly manipulative, leading Woody away. If it was all about Woody moving on because he is a natural leader, then that doesn't justify joining Bo since she's already the established leader of that group.
This movie has been rightly compared to Ralph Breaks the Internet, and even though Vanellope's motivations for leaving felt rushed (and, like Toy Story 4, featured a highly telegraphed ending in the trailers), it worked better because it felt relatively consistent with the character arcs of both her and Ralph. Plus, at least that movie left open the possibility of the lead characters seeing each other again. In Endgame (SPOILERS!), the reason Captain America's ending works is because not only has his love for Agent Carter been long established, providing believable motivation for his choice at the movie's conclusion, but he also has been feeling out of place in the modern world since The Avengers. Endgame, even with its major death, feels more satisfying because its conclusion fits with the arc that was established over multiple movies (End Spoilers). Toy Story 4's ending feels wrong because it was built upon hastily-constructed motives that are supported nowhere else in the franchise. If Woody's departure was inevitable, then framing it around an older Bonnie giving up the toys after years have passed would have made more sense. That would have given Woody slightly better motivation other than simply being upset about not being a favorite (again), even though Bonnie could easily just be going through an anti-Woody phase. This way, Buzz's line about Bonnie not needing him would make more sense. It also would have worked in real-time since years have passed since the third and fourth movies, just like the gap between the second and third.
If Toy Story 4 had been a stand-alone film, it would not be receiving such high praise. The only reason we cry at this ending is because we love the bond established in the previous three films. True fans of the series would do their best to ignore that this ever happened and cap the series at 3 (as well as the Toy Story Toons and TV Specials). It's only the second-worse Pixar movie because it wasn't as boring and forgettable as The Good Dinosaur.
Indeed, if ""story is king"" at Pixar, it is clear the monarch has officially been dethroned.",Toy Story 4,2019-06-21,7.8,207464,2019
tt1979376,3,"As much as I love the Toy Story universe, this one is that bad, that I would wish to not remember watching it at all.The film did make incorporate a lot of nostalgic elements and over-the-top jokes that you would be sure to have a laugh and smile a bit.But the plot itself is incoherent and not a bit faithful to the trilogy. It forcefully introduces a scene that has never been mentioned at all in the previous Toy Story films, and it drives the entire plot onwards. The ending was also abrupt, and the friendship and romantic buildup in the past 3 films seems completely ruined just within a few minutes at the end.The ending was abrupt also because I felt like the story was supposed to continue while it suddenly came to an end. There were so, so many questions left unanswered that even should Pixar make another sequel, it will never be able to address all of them.The message of spreading individualism and feminist-esque hints throughout the film seems to be screaming out too much at points in the film.The individualist aspect also defeats the values of the ""Toys"", precisely every admirable act by Woody in the past seems to be meaningless and ""wrong"", simply he was not thinking for himself.",Toy Story 4,2019-06-21,7.8,207464,2019

tt1979376,1,"I really truly believe Pixar could've came up with a way better story line. There were so many avenues to pursue after TS3 ended. The commonality of all TS movies is the beautiful animation portrayed. With that aside, this one has way too much focus on Woody and Peep to start...I was 10 when the first Toy Story came out. I'm now a 34 yr old mom of two kids- 6/8 who love toy story, as we all do. I leave this review with open minded opinion that it has been nine years since the third one-we can get fixated on an ending and expect otherwise- and yet- the fourth one feels overreached and lacking those ""clever"" scenes the previous three all have. Contradictions glaring. There were maybe two times the heart of the Toy Story we all know prevailed in the movie. Other than that, I felt no warmth of connection to the plot. It was like; ""let's just create a movie and see what happens!"" The entire script was a complete heartbreak.""Forky"" was cute for a scene. Woody's obsession to please Bonnie keeping Forky around seemed overdone- Bonnie didn't want to play with Woody since the opening scene anyway. I was more interested in how Woody was going to transcend this form of rejection. Afterall, Bonnie loved her ""cowboy"" in TS3. He was the last toy Andy gave to her!Woody convincing Forky (who wants to be trash and free) that he's ""lucky"" to have a kid and Woody actually ends up leaving the kid to be ""free.""What about Andy not wanting to play with Woody in the past? Was Andy more worthy of a kid than Bonnie?? (Woody could've left years ago?)Woody is a loyal cowboy and would ""never give up on you"", yet, he leaves everyone. To be with Bo. Who's character, albeit, is strong and well characterized, lacks connection between the two. We knew nothing much of Bo prior?!Toy story for 24 years has been about the kid. A toy is a toy and purpose fulfilled when with a kid. That was the imagination beauty to these toys that have lives with THE KID. The toys are selfless- that's their beauty! Now it's about the self approached ego toy? This left a ""What's best for Woody"" human- feel. He's not quite a toy now- he's a robotic person doing what he wants when he wants. ""I'm going with Bo so we can be toys living as people out here in the wilderness. You guys just keep getting played with and when Bonnie's done, just leave her too."" Who's next? Each ""toy"" for their own? What is this nonsense?The dummies were frightening. My son had a difficult time watching the ""villains"" attempt to take and sew up Woody to remove his voice box. Did Woody really need to go through ""surgery?""Rather than add to the Toy Story family like the previous ones did, how we grew to love characters like Ken and Barbie, Mr/Mrs Potato head, the aliens and ""the claw"", etc. It was sad, sadistic and filled with new toys who's characters appeared over exaggerated to fill in a plot which appeared to not even have one in the first place. Less Buzz, Rex, Slinky, Bullseye and other favorites as well. I couldn't wait till it was over. Of all the amazing films coming out this year so far, (2019), I'd say Aladdin and Detective Pikachu surpass this one.Maybe I am older now and set in my grown ways of watching this toy family stick together through everything.

tt1979376,1,"I created an IMDB account purely for the purpose of reviewing this movie. This movie was terrible, perhaps that is a bit unfair - this movie was twisted, demonic, pointless and without the uplifting light that had been in previous versions of the franchise.Do I think this is harsh? No. Disney claimed after Toy Story 3 there would be no further sequels - and while TS3 was very dark as well, it was a fitting conclusion to the final chapter of the trilogy. I am a fan of nearly all things mouse, but Disney has taken a decidedly dark turn recently. Cinema (especially children's cinema) is about escapism, happiness and good messages, this was not that.Now to the review: Toy Story broke the mold when it came to the creation of animated cinema. Toy Story 4 felt like a mashup of Mission Impossible meets Child's Play. The usual sight gags, and innuendos are not there, instead jump scares, refuse jokes and poor dialogue were utilized for a few cheap laughs, that left a theater full of children mostly silent, and their parents chuckling a couple times.The central theme of the movie seems to be that Woody can't let go of making sure that Bonnie (the new Andy) is happy. Woody reconnects with an old flame - and a love story is born, where there didn't need to be one. Time drags on as Woody (who is sans Buzz for most of the movie) tries to rescue this lost toy again and again, ultimately failing on his own without the help of a new group of toys.Buzz for his part is turned into a bumbling idiot, who hearkens back to when he first discovered he was a toy. Repeatedly pressing the buttons on his suit believing they are his ""conscious"", and making poor choices based on them as well.The antagonist is a toy very similar to Lotso (TS3 villian) who hasn't felt the love and affection they want, steals from others to get it, so children are taught that as long as what you take benefits you - it's OK. Ultimately the antagonist is partially redeamed at the end, just in time for the gang to get back together again.Except - remember the love story above, Woody abandons his previous position of making his child happy, and instead decides to throw it all away for the woman of his dreams, in a very channeling of Jerry McGuire Woody splits up the dynamic duo of Woody and Buzz and instead decides to go play house for all the misfit toys.Two final notes, there is no mini movie beforehand, and the after credits scene that use to be bloopers are instead some more garbage in the vein of the end of the movie. Highly disappointing, saddening, and depressing to see that Disney instead of allowing a Franchise that revolutionized an era to remain on high, instead is bringing it crashing down for it's insatiable love of green.",Toy Story 4,2019-06-21,7.8,207464,2019

The characters you know and love are barley in the movie (besides woody), which wouldnt be a bad thing if the new characters were worth anything. The new characters get really no back story or introduction and you are just suppose to care about these characters like you do about the ones that have been around for 20 years.The big complaint is how it ends. I wont spoil it for people who havent seen it, but it goes against everything all the other toy story movies go for (including the shorts). Sure some will say its a story about growth and change, but it completely ruins the whole franchise.

tt1979376,7,"Toy Story 4 (2019)Watching this animated film as an adult, I was thinking during the first half an hour why was this even made? Why am I watching a cartoon about a pathetic looking spork made of chewing gum and why all the fuss about it? Couldn't they come up with something better in 9 years? As it went along, the story improved and at the end I did enjoy it but no way near as the previous ones.The new toys are different from what we saw in the earlier movies and have some interesting personalities which lead to good toy-chemistry and some funny moments. The plot has some originality but at times feels repetitive with decisions being forced and characters acting inconsistent to their personalities not to mention some of them being left behind as a whole. Also, the fact that the entire plot hinges on a spork, makes it difficult to fully appreciate despite the philosophical points and messages that it sends.I did enjoy the first 3 Toy Stories but I felt that this one fell short of its predecessors in establishing an emotional connection and leaving me with a feeling of overall wholesomeness by the end of the story which is sad because this is what Pixar has always been known for. As an adult, I would not say that this one is a must watch unless you are a die hard fan of the franchise or have children.

tt1979376,2,"What a way to just stomp over everything us 90's kids grew up with and were very passionate about as buzz and woody always did the right thing by everyone especially their kid be it Andy or now Bonnie.The thing I find very hard to accept with this film is how some very big decisions and feelings are just pushed aside ignoring character traits all just to reach out to the new young generation.For example at the end of Toy story 3 when Andy gives Bonnie all of his beloved toys including Buzz and Woody, Bonnie loves and respects the toys as much as Andy did this making the audience feel extremely sad but somewhat assured that Andy has picked a good child.This does not seem to be the case as in this film Bonnie couldn't care less about Woody but plays with literally every other toy that Andy gave her, this is just completely unbelievable and shows the writers have completely lost their way.This film has just created new pointless characters just to sell more merchandise to the new young generation but these characters are nowhere as near as charming or charismatic as when Jessie, Bullseye, Weezy and Stinky Pete where introduced.One point that nearly made me walk out was when Woody willingly gave Dolly his voicebox and the film just glazed over this with no one reacting to what he has done not even Buzz, Jessie or Bo Peep witch brought no weight or shock or sadness as the film didn't seem think it was a big deal.The end of the film makes no sense woody would never leave his kid even if he wasn't getting played with as much, that's his kid and woody is very loyal, he was abandoned for years in Andy's Toy box until Andy went off the Collage, Bonnie has just started kindergarten and woody for some reason can't wait forever and just decided not only to abandon Bonnie but everyone he has ever known and loved including Buzz, Jessie & Bulseye instead of trying to persuade Bo Peep to join him.Over all I whole heartedly hated the film and hope they leave it be now I consider the film to be a trilogy and will only purchase the film to add to the collection but will not rush to watch this again as it is not the Toy Story I knew and loved growing up.I hope Pixar now move on to new and original stories instead of ruining beloved childhood movies.",Toy Story 4,2019-06-21,7.8,207464,2019

And when you enter you are attacked by a rabid Rafiki from Lion King.Once on Mars, you are able to sneak into the rocket to Neptune even though you were standing on the ground under the rocket engines when the count down was at 10. And, for some reason, you had to swim underwater in a space suit quite a ways to get to the rocket.When you get to Neptune, you park your rocket, and I mean park, on the opposite side of the rings so you have to go through the rings on the way down to loony pops and come back through the rings with a makeshift shield that you removed from the outside of the spacecraft with no tools while wearing a spacesuit.To get back home from Neptune to Earth you are propelled the whole way by the nuclear bomb that you used to destroy loony pops' ship.

tt2935510,2,"Let me begin by saying that I'm being generous with my rating of 2 stars. This movie was a disappointment on so many levels. The science was completely wrong. There were elements of the cinematography and overall visuals that deserve some credit. But apart from that, the movie left much to be desired.As a fan of space movies and Brad Pitt, I went in expecting an epic, but left disappointed. On one hand there are movies like gravity that keep you on the edge of your seat literally gasping for breath. While this was a 2 hour closeup of Brad's face and had very little, if anything, to do with space.Here's what was wrong with the movie.
Firstly, the movie fails to show the vastness of space with skewed distances and timelines.Secondly, space, a place that requires calculations and accuracy down to the millimeter. But we see Brad eyeballing his jump thru rocks and debris orbiting neptune, while holding a piece of sheet metal as a shield, yet perfectly nailing his jump and landing on his rocket.Sneaking into a rocket from a magical airlock near the thrusters after lift-off ? Erm.... NO!Discharging a firearm in a pressurised confined space travelling through deep space, hmm... what could go wrong?Using a nuclear explosion as propulsion? Science and logic both took a major hit there.I could rant on......Somewhere between the unexplained lunar pirates and unnecessary killer baboons, the storyline just fell flat. Even an actor as amazing as Brad Pitt could not save the movie. It is nothing more than a drama about daddy issues, the setting for which just happened to be space. The backdrop could easily have been an old people's home and it wouldn't have mattered.The people who have rated this film highly are wannabe intellectuals who are pretending to understand a ""deeper psychological meaning"" that just isn't there.

Things wrong with this film.Brad Pitt was pegged as some super dude, doesn't panic, heart rate doesn't go above 80 robot until he thinks about his dad. Then he becomes an emotional wreck.On the way to Mars they have to stop and nip on board a space craft that's been taken over by angry space monkeys. The only reason this was here was to kill off the captain so that brad Pitt could land the space ship when things got bumpy (because the second in command was to scared to touch the controls?)Throughout the entire film there was no feeling of the vastness of space. In fact it made it feel like Jupiter and Neptune were just down the road.Moon pirates, what were they about? What was their goal when attacking them. Some suggestion of hostage taking which is weird cause it seemed like they were trying to kill them all?You won't get to Neptune without me? Erm I'm pretty sure they would have and accomplished exactly the same goal. Guess you didn't need to kill them all after all brad? But it's ok because when you get back to Earth all will be forgiven, forgotten, well one of them.The heroic leap from one space ship to another using a panel to deflect all of Neptune's ring rocks. Erm not sure that would work. Hold it gets better. I'm going to use the nuclear explosion to propel me home. Erm....... no.Tommy Lee Jones after spending god knows how many years on the space ship trying to achieve his goal of finding aliens going so far as to kill his crew so that he could carry on. Just leaves without any fuss. Oh no changed my mind I'd prefer it if I just floated off into space. Ok dad see you later.The upshot is this feels like one of those films that's a really slow build up with a massive twist at the end. However there's no massive twist. Nothing is really explained and all of it is really unnecessary. It just ends.I developed no emotional attachment to any of the characters. The story arc is stupid, the acts the lead character accomplish are unbelievable and his part in the story was unimportant. (They would have gone anyway, found the ship, blown it up and the unexplained thing that was going to kill us all would have been stopped)It is beyond me how it's rated so high and if anyone can explain what I missed or how this is actually a good film I'm willing to hear it.",Ad Astra,2019-09-20,6.5,202119,2019

(How about the continuity of Moons gravity, once in the Rocket facility everyone is marching around with Earth grav - seconds earlier the rover ((based on a version 2 1969 variant?)) floated almost with no gravity influence)And the stupidity of the facility on the Moon - absolutely huge, looked about as big as downtown Vegas, but they are still driving around in open top rovers, and flying Rockets that look like last years Atlas Rocket or somethingRidiculous plot is established that requires Pitt's character to fly via the Moon to Mars to make a god damn phone call from a pathetic sound studio style booth to his dad, for WHAT!? Apparently to gain a reply, so they can locate the ship. Well they KNEW it was at Neptune (granted a big planet, but really, a phone call to a ship that hasn't been heard for 15years or something). Liv & Donald's characters should not have been in the film, these added nothing, and just added more frustration from the underwhelming utilisation of their known talents.BTW the idea that you can casually stop midway from Earth to Mars to check on a distress call was utter CRAP- they had to be going at something like 525,000mph to get to Mars in the 6 days or whatever the ship said, and the idea that they could stop, make the door call (to a ship that had rampant Chimpanzees solely there to remove the Captain character) and then get back up to that speed is pretty far reaching. The bad acting by supporting roles, such as the fumbling Co-Pilot who froze during landing, and my favourite - the lady in the check in area on Mars, who was flapping fingers on the key board vaguely like it was a 8yr olds play or something.The hilarious water manhole on Mars cracked me up - WTF and why was there a rope thing to grab?

Brad is all over the place.
The film starts with a great sequence for approx. 7 minutes, which is captivating and visually stunning. Unfortunately, then it gets to a slow-burn mode till the story develops a bit more and we get to see another visually impressive sequence past 30 minutes. It does get more interesting later on and together with the visual impact (a kind of dreamy action sequences) and the nicely written score you will want to sit this through the end.
Acting is good and for fans of Brad Pitt, this works perfect as he is in almost every scene.
Science...well i am not an expert here but the things portrayed in the film are not really tied to exact science. It is the future after all and humanity knows more, right? I would not read too much into that; it will help you enjoy the film more.
In contrast with some negative and maybe unrealistic reviews that I read here, if you like a mix of mild father-son drama together with sci-fi, this is a very nice film to watch.

tt2935510,3,"I'm a big fan of Sci-fi movies, when they actually make sense...
As visually impressive as it might be at times, Ad Astra tries to be a psychological drama set in space. Only that it fails as a psychological drama and it's almost an insult to the space Sci-fi genre.You clearly see a movie failing when a grandiose or highly abstract topic revolves around the personal stories of a character or two, it makes it feel ""cheap"" or sloppy (yes, I'm thinking Interstellar also). If you place the main story in any other setting, some details change but the main idea can be left untouched, so is this a Sci-fi movie? Is this a space movie? And if it's not, why is it wrapped up like one?As some reviews describe, the main story is unconvincing at best, with a very sloppy script. Decisions feel forced for the sake of suspense, the journey totally predictable, there is no depth in the character construction.
However the worse part, which I consider almost an insult to the genre, is the message that can be read between the lines: ""believe and do not question"". It's almost like a bored priest in the Vatican decided to sabotage a Sci-fi movie.
I gave this a bit of thought and I can't remember any other Sci-fi movie being as anti-Sci-fi as this one.It gets 3 stars for the visuals and Brad Pitt's effort, but it could have (should have) been so so so much better!",Ad Astra,2019-09-20,6.5,202119,2019

This can be a metaphor for space itself- always quiet, but is very complex inside.The end of the movie (without spoiling it) also works with that logic- there is no loud Inception horn, in fact, seemingly it's pretty relaxed, but you can still sense the tension and emotions going on.Now that's what I call ""show don't tell""",Ad Astra,2019-09-20,6.5,202119,2019

tt2935510,4,"Where do I begin?Not an action movie although many action scenes. Not a psychological thriller although many attempted ""deep and philosophical"" monologues and constant ""psychological"" assessments. A family adventure? Ha!This, similar to Gravity, is a cinematographic delight wrapped in an awful plot, terrible script, some really jarring technical flaws (to be discussed later) and some totally ridiculous scenes that were thrown in as an afterthought to try keep us from falling asleep at Brad's constant monotonic narration about nothing.The ridiculous scenes:
* Raging space baboons
* Space pirates hell bent on destruction but without reason
* A military convoy of buggies with only a few hand guns in a known Warzone
* The crazed father hellbent on staying but leaves without a whisper
* Giant neon Marlboro Man visible only to space pirates...
* Rockets land in one place and take off in another in the middle of nowhere
* Underwater tunnels in the middle of nowhere that lead to the rocket
*Brad sneaks through said tunnel to climb aboard said rocket during launch... OMG
The list is endless..The technical flaws:
* A sky high Tower within the Earth's gravitational field built from Meccano sets of infinite strength
* Brad happens to be wearing a parachute with his spacesuit
* Astronauts who playfully release liquids in zero gravity amongst life critical electronic equipment
* Brad never grows a beard or hair in 79 days of space travel on the way there but grows just a bit on the way back
* Cosmic waves that increase in power the further from the source
* The source is a massive unexplained disc on the side spaceship. What was that built for?
* Brad's all environments self repairing light material spacesuit
* Dozens of cheap plastic Casio calculators stuck willy nilly on every bit of equipment
* Airlocks, or should I say none..
* Climbs aboard a rocket 2 seconds before launch and survives the g-forces just standing inside the door
And the list goes onSome fantastic cinematography. Truly worth seeing in IMAX as I did. You can almost understand why Flat Earthers believe everything is fake as the imagery is so real! Amazing.But...Overall, a mess of a movie!",Ad Astra,2019-09-20,6.5,202119,2019

The motivations and behaviors of the characters are absurd. Don't even get me started on the scientific explanations. It is a big budget movie. They could have hired someone to make legitimate explanations. It's just massively insulting that they didn't even try. Story is just not good.The visuals are beautiful and the VFX look good but honestly, they could be so much better. Looks like the director intentionally didn't want the movie to be about the visuals but rather about the characters. But the characters are uninteresting and not developed well. It's just disappointing. There is one action scene. A space fight on the moon in lunar buggies.

tt2935510,9,"Disclaimer: Ad Astra is a masterful psychological drama disguised as a gorgeous sci-fi epic. This is not the next popcorn space adventure flick some were desperately waiting for. In fact, it is way more than that.Driven by some of the greatest acting Brad Pitt has ever produced, James Gray's most ambitious film to date is a total treat for the eyes. Here, cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema is reaching new heights of creativity in his artistic vision, which easily differentiates his present work from the likes of Interstellar (especially those scenes with Ruth Negga are spectacular). Special reference must be made to the beautifully generated special effects, which really make this movie a contender for the most realistic depiction of space (as Gray himself had in mind). Camera doesn't shy away from taking a closer look at its protagonist, using angles that elevate every aspect of his skillfuly understated performance. As the story moves deeper in space (and Roy plunges deeper into the hidden wounds of his psyche), Pitt's exceptionally well-executed facial expressions, eye movements and mannerisms reveal fragments of instability to an almost frightening extent, given how much of a calculated, calm and disciplined person the leading character seemed to be on the outside. You can virtually see Roy's deconstruction and recontruction throughout this epic journey into the abyss (of outer space and human soul).Questions are raised, and answers are not always easy to digest. A life devoted to achieving a ""greater"" professional/scientific (but not necessarily noble) goal can lead to alienation and eventually abstaining from life itself. And it's not like it's always a rewarding journey. It often just leaves behind severely traumatized souls, as Gray's depressive, introspective space drama depicts in the most touching way.If there are any negatives to be pointed out: Perhaps a little too many references to Apocalypse Now (at least I found them a bit distracting).p.s.: Many haters will desperately try to discredit this film. The easiest path is to rant about the screenplay and overly focus on supposed ""plot holes"", taking the plot at face value despite the movie's metaphorical approach. Sadly, they are missing the main themes along with every point it tries to make. It's actually very absurd, since most of the scepticists are obviously fans of Interstellar, whose ending is a plot hole the size of a... black hole! Don't let these hateful attacks distort the experience of this thrilling journey into the soul.",Ad Astra,2019-09-20,6.5,202119,2019
tt2935510,NA,"A completely pedestrian journey AWAY from SOL - A string of skits along the way from Earth to Moon then Mars and Neptune. Devoid of technology that could have made the progress more believable eg Space Elevators and Lunar Electromagnetic payload propulsion.The special effects, costume and set designs were perfectly executed but this can not hide the fact it seems was written by someone with no actual enthusiasm or technical background for the subject. It is 51 years since 2001: A Space Odyssey yet the only progress in film production since then is a better rendered lunar rover experience. The great visuals are the slight of hand to cover a weak story. This is not The Expanse you might be expecting.When you run out of ideas plucked from the obvious in the genre; 2001, THX1138, Genesis II, Total Recall, Event Horizon, mix in some baboons from Wizard of Oz and an uderwater scene from Trainspotting?. Try and make it critically credible by reworking the ending from Gravity and convince viewers it was all a journey about humanity, depression and relationships.Last week I saw Apollo 11 and spent the first 30 minutes fighting back tears. Halfway through Ad Astra and I was closing one eye in hope my brain would view something half interesting.I can only feel this was rated highly by people with no actual life or film experience ie. born this century.",Ad Astra,2019-09-20,6.5,202119,2019

Are we willing to continue until the end regardless of the consequences? Do we become what we judge without realizing it? The story that the film tells us has a very deep meaning and explores the most hidden corners of the human being. A slow movie that goes through the stages of degradation and collapse of an individual feeling lost and the will to continue forward and get up to reach a goal.

tt2935510,9,"I love seeing different ways in which new space films can expand the genre. Ad Astra takes the unique approach of mostly avoiding thrills in favor of a deep dive into the protagonist's psyche. While some may argue about Gray's approach, I believe the film's resolution more than justifies this tactic. Brad Pitt gives a tremendous, understated performance in which you really feel the emotions his character experiences. The cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema is truly stunning and produced several shots which will likely live on in space film history.

more jokes;a whole lot of new characters;a fresh look at the existing characters;plenty of new locations and thus, much more adventures;an absolute muddle of what's happening on the screen;and yes, even more jokes!Given the above, it's time to wrap it up - «Jumanji: The Next Level» is a solid following of a 2017's movie. It's all about laughter, fun, amusement and adventures, of course.

tt7975244,8,"Mild, mild spoilers ahead....I was scared they'd somehow screw up the sequel to the ""reboot"" they did, but I was greatly surprise at the new elements they added: the grandpa's subplot and the way it was executed and their contribution to the jumanji gaming experience (they were both hilarious); and all the new additions felt exactly how a sequel to a 90s sequel game would feel like: new abilities and weapons and scenery (or the would-be ""levels"" of the game) they still felt like they'd actually be levels of a game! It's exactly what I hoped they'd add on because that's the kind of thing the first movie did, it tried to work with the stereotypes and elements found in those good old adventure games like Tomb Raider.I also liked that they brought back the WHOLE gang, the reason why movies like this where the most logical thing would be to make it anthologic, that is, with different kids experiencing the game; so when they try to use the same characters that supposedly learned something from their past experience in it, is a recipe for disaster because it's hard to bring all the gang together without it being forced. But i liked the way they did it, it felt controlled and fulfilling in the end.In conclusion, it was a funny, entertaining and creative action adventure movie, it's not gonna win any Oscars but it's so wrll thought of that it's a delight to watch and I feel it never grows old, you can rewatch it and enjoy it all over again",Jumanji: The Next Level,2019-12-13,6.6,192964,2019

However, this is a great bunch of likable comedy actors/young actors being given the freedom to have fun in these roles. There are also some exciting set-pieces and creative vfx. It was a wise choice to bring back the entire cast too, with some new additions.

Yeah, I have to admit there were some repeated patterns from the first one but along the way they also added several stuffs which brought fresh air to the whole movie.Also, I think the sequel conveyed deeper messages than the first one, potrayed by the characters problem in it, in which we can related to our real life. Lesson I got from this sequel: Sometimes you will hit the end but it doesn't mean it is over. It means, all you have to do is living the present and look it with different perspectives.From the plot of the story, it kinds of light and predictable, but hey, it is a decent sequel you can enjoy with your family.

tt7975244,7,"Even though its central concept seems ever-so-slightly more strained this time, 'Jumanji: The Next Level (2019)' is about as good as its predecessor. In fact, it's sometimes even better. Basically, the flick is just fun. The crowd-pleasing body-swapping is amped up to eleven, shaking things up just enough so that they feel fresh. The main actors continue to properly impress in their chameleon-like roles, joined by a few extra treats that perform far better than you'd perhaps expect. Indeed, these new players are probably its biggest asset; a couple of them thoroughly perforate the entire experience despite only having a rather small amount of screen-time. The picture is often funny - though, never hilarious - and is oddly endearing, to boot. It isn't particularly deep or, even, memorable but it doesn't need to be. It's a good time at the movies; what more do you need? Obviously some better theming and, perhaps, a tad of nuance wouldn't go amiss, but it's just not that kind of film really and that's perfectly fine. Even if it doesn't impact you as much as some of the year's best, it'll certainly make you smile and keep you entertained for a couple of hours. Besides, its inciting incident is driven purely by character and it even manages to squeeze some genuine emotional connection, via a well-drawn dynamic between DeVito and Glover, into its otherwise otherworldly proceedings. Its acting is also deceptively simple but decidedly fantastic, fully immersing you in the idea that these major stars are actually four teenagers and two old men. Basically, it's not as simple as you might think. 7/10",Jumanji: The Next Level,2019-12-13,6.6,192964,2019

Won't say who it was, but if you're older than 20, chances are good you like the person.The action is like last time, it's entertaining, but not mind blowing. The effects are overall good. The Rock has some, lets call them punching scenes, which I liked. Although the action direction overall, could have been slightly better, tighter.They once again have fun with the fact that the characters ""in game"" represent characters in the movies ""real life"". And I am pretty impressed with how the actors fared. Maybe especially Dwayne Johnson. (I think he's taking some serious acting classes, he's getting better) Overall the cast in this is very likeable.I didn't feel quite that much that I was in a video game, this time around though. Felt more like just an adventure, than an adventure videogame. They could have hammered home a little better.
So yeah, I was entertained, but it's pretty shallow and won't stick with me like, say, the origianl Jumanji. (I watched that as a kid, and it was kind of revolutionary, so of course it stuck) Nice family flick.",Jumanji: The Next Level,2019-12-13,6.6,192964,2019

tt9243946,7,"Seriously, do yourself a favor and ignore any 10/10 perfect scores. It's a fine conclusion to Jesse's story but not some masterpiece. This is a movie that we all honestly could've done without and have done without for what, the past 5 years? This movie has it's moments but it is never brilliant like the show. Even taken on its own, as a movie, it's nothing special. For a movie to be a 10 or even an 8 you should be special and this movie very much isn't.",El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie,2019-10-11,7.3,187940,2019
tt9243946,10,"El Camino was not only an amazing sequel to the series finale of Breaking Bad, but an amazing movie itself. The movie is set immediately after the events of Breaking Band's finale, showcasing Jesse Pinkman in his car, driving away. It brings back the familiar faces of characters like Mike, Badger, Skinny Pete, etc. It was full of suspense, having viewers on edge about what would happen to Jesse throughout the course of the film. The cinematography in this movie was amazing, there were so many beautiful shots that could be used as a wallpaper, both as a Breaking Bad fan or in general. It was slightly comedic, but very dark. The movie is filled with flashbacks and Jesse's memories of the Neo Nazis he was forced to work for, even showcasing his good/peaceful side that shows he doesn't want violence to be his first option, yet, he needs it to be one after everything he had been through. I was originally going to watch it in theaters, but I couldn't help myself, being a huge Breaking Bad fan myself. I believe you'd love this film, if you haven't watched breaking bad, then go watch it. The show had amazing writing, acting, directing, etc. This movie is less like long Breaking Bad episode, and more like a tribute to a character who needed more closure, it closes Jesse's story well. Vince Gilligan did well in creating a continuation to a series that ended amazingly. Again, a 10/10 from me. Tried to keep it as spoiler free as possible lmao.",El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie,2019-10-11,7.3,187940,2019
tt9243946,7,"Well as someone who really enjoyed the journey that Walter and Jesse shared in Breaking bad I gotta say this was a solid ending for the whole story.
however, this could have easily been an extra episode rather than a whole movie but i'm really glad that the whole breaking bad story is kinda finished and they are not gonna make a whole sequel of movies unlike most franchises nowadays.
Anyone who has watched the BB series should watch this just don't get your expectations too high.",El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie,2019-10-11,7.3,187940,2019
tt9243946,8,"To those saying its ""a masterpiece"": It's not. There's nothing in this movie we haven't seen before and that's ok. In its context and with the background this is a solid sendoff for Jesse with some amazing moments and some good fanservice (maybe 1° too much for my taste).It was not as good as I hoped it would be, but it's certainly a good movie and I'm happy this hasn't gone wrong.Not sure if Vince is planning on doing some more of these, but I'd be down.",El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie,2019-10-11,7.3,187940,2019
tt9243946,7,"This was very good, of course, it was always going to be. It was cool to see what happened to Jesse and also really good to see some old characters. The trouble was, Todd got fat and I couldn't get past it. I lost whole scenes thinking why couldn't he just go on a diet for like a month?Anyway, it was cool and fun to go back to BB - not quite worth all the hype though unfortunately.",El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie,2019-10-11,7.3,187940,2019

I don't know maybe its just me but this movie felt empty , like it didn't make a difference in jesse pinkman's story.",El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie,2019-10-11,7.3,187940,2019
tt9243946,6,"Like many people, I believe that breaking bad is the best tv series of all time. Much of this credit goes to Vince Gilligan who is meticulous for detail and placing strands that eventually weave together to form a brilliantly coherent story with no stray threads. This is the main reason why I am so disappointed in El Camino:With Gilligan's eye for detail, why on earth didn't he tell the actors to try to get in the same shape they were in 6 years ago? Nobody is shaming anybody for their body image, but all the comments regarding ""continuity"" are well founded when we are so used to masterful story telling and world building from Vince. It is distracting and takes you out of the moment.The writing is also not at the level we are used to - we are made to believe that Robert Forster's (RIP) character was a true professional by insisting that Jessie pay the full amount due. I'm fine with that, BUT if you want to portray the character in this way, why on earth would he leave the vehicle that he uses to smuggle away the state's most wanted criminals in plain view at his place of business?? It makes no sense and is out of character! However, the real reason he asked for the full amount of money was so we could see Jessie have a wild west duel with a welder for some reason..... What happened with the writing here???Aaron Paul's acting was very good, but I'm sorry the whole thing felt like it was made solely for the money. I understand that the reason why people work is for money (writer's, directors etc), but you should at least stick to your vision and not rush these things for a quick paycheck.",El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie,2019-10-11,7.3,187940,2019
tt9243946,6,"Was this movie made by the same author who made Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul? Did he put less effort in this than in his average 45 minute episode? Does aging really have this rapid deteriorating effects on both the director and the actors? This movie poses so many troubling questions.The plot of the movie is very simple, and is delivered in a confident manner of some filler episodes of the famous series. Cameos, done as mostly flashbacks, of Mike, Heisenberg, Jane the girlfriend are all checked in an OK way. What movie lacks is interesting plot or any surprises. One particularly stupid gunfight falls far short of the standards even of filler episodes of the main series. We do not get to see what happened to Walt's family (did his plagiarizing rich friends deliver the goods etc), and closure regards mostly Jesse, but that is not the real reason the movie is so bland. One cringe worthy flashback involves fat Todd, who should have been digitalized or put on some heavy diet (as should have some other actors who aged much, deep fakes should have done the job). The one nice point was friendship of skinny Pete and Badger, but the whole thing felt like one stretched out and mostly filler episode. Quite mediocre for a feature film, and disappointing given the quality of the series, yet I will mark it a bit over what it deserves on account of good old days (should be rated much closer to the bottom objectively).",El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie,2019-10-11,7.3,187940,2019

tt9243946,9,"Okay, so full disclosure. I am a HUGE Breaking Bad fan. I have watched the entire series three times, and then I have watched it ANOTHER SIX TIMES, skipping an episode here and there. I have turned countless people on to it, because in my opinion, anyone who has not seen it has robbed themselves. I have debated on how every single episode is a work of art. In short, in reply to the question of if I were stranded on a desert island with only one ""thing"" - the complete BrBa series would probably be my answer. :)That said, I am not oblivious to its minor flaws. The fact that I love it so much does not mean I cannot be objective about it. It just means that it is deserving of such praise.This brings me to El Camino.Is it perfect? No.Is it riveting? Absofrickinlutely!First and foremost, before watching it, the viewer needs to understand that El Camino did not have a theater opening. Vince Gilligan, and I assume everyone involved, knew what this was - and it is not meant to be a blockbuster film, but simply, the goodbye so many of us have been asking for.Was this goodbye perfect? Not entirely. In my opinion, it would have gone a long way to being a WHOLE lot closer to perfect if the first 29 minutes could have been condensed into 15.Those minutes kind of dragged, and while parts were moving and sweet - again, it dragged. Thank god that at 29 minutes in, it began to gain momentum, and while still slow in parts, the tension and the build-up was fantastic. Seeing most of your favorite (and hated) characters, and not only SEEING them, but FEELING your way into their minds, was amazing. (Yes, Todd IS distracting as you must have already read from other viewers). Why could they not have waited until he lost some weight? Offered him lipo? Used CGI? We'll never know - and if there is a main problem with the film, the difference in Todd is it). If one manages to put that aside, however and watch it for what it is, it is pure Breaking Bad at its best.The climax is kind of difficult to explain. I guess again, it wasn't perfect, but it was SO DAMN GOOD. I know it sounds like an oxymoron, but you just have to watch it. Oh, and here, I must tell you to do yourself/yourselves a favor and avoid all kinds of spoilers about it.The time leading up to the end was the best part of the entire thing. It was tasteful, poignant, touching, moving, funny ... and almost a love letter of sorts to all us fans.The actual end was pretty good and almost satisfying, but in my opinion (and I think many would agree), it would have been better had another character been brought in to complete the circle, even if they had to skip to the ""future"". While they did touch on this story arc at the ending, it was much too vague to appreciate.All in all, a solid 7.5-8, but considering it was preceded and born out of the most subtly monumental series in history, I HAD to up it to a 9.Am I a fan girl? Perhaps. But the movie and above that, the series above any series ever, deserves to have fans.Holy heck. I love you Breaking bad.",El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie,2019-10-11,7.3,187940,2019
tt9243946,7,"Here's a honest review. It's solid but not great. It tells the story of what happens to Jesse following the events of Breaking Bad and what he needs to do to try and flee the town. If you're expecting the high octane drama of Breaking Bad, it's not here. It's a suspenseful slow-burn that left me feeling like I didn't get what I was expecting. Cool little story about Jesse, but not the fireworks that is Breaking Bad.

Several scenes felt stretched a minute or two longer than necessary. The result is a slowly told suspense story with Jesse encountering too many conveniently timed coincidences and hurdles, one after the other, than believable or perhaps I mean tolerable to the viewer.I'm a fan of the original series and consider it to be one of the best TV shows of all time.

All the new characters, none of which are remotely memorable? This movie just didn't need to happen. It didn't help that the characters look visibly older (and in Todd's case, 10x fatter) which takes you out of the experience.It wasn't horrible, but it isn't good enough to stand alone, nor is it up to the quality of Breaking Bad Season 5, where the franchise left off.

tt7984734,9,"Robert Eggers' second (?) feature is a superb piece of mind-bending cinema. There are parallels with his earlier film, The Witch, elements of psychological horror which Eggers clearly finds interesting and hopefully hasn't finished exploring just yet.
The decision to film in black and white is a stroke of genius. Every scene is filled with ominous portent and obscuring shadows. The film plays with our perceptions and moods throughout. There are moments of comedy amongst the gloom, the two men stranded on the rock endure a tumultuous relationship, by turns suspicious, angry and even savage, then there are unexpected moments of comradeship fuelled by alcohol. We are forced to question constantly who is mad, or perhaps madder? Are they in the grip of a storm, or are they in Hell?
And the soundtrack! No one I can think of uses sound to create atmosphere quite like Eggers. Foghorns, the relentlessly howling wind, the seagulls; is it any wonder if they were as mad as a box of frogs?
Willem Dafoe is absolutely fantastic in The Lighthouse. He really should be considered for an Oscar for his turn as the saltiest of old seadogs, spouting rage-filled Melville-esque invective straight from Davey Jones' locker, at sporadic intervals. I don't think there are many actors who could've pulled off that performance with such aplomb. He chews the scenery mercilessly, but it is exactly what the role requires; his Thomas Wake is a force of nature in human form.
The Lighthouse won't be to everyone's taste, and it would be a mistake to view it as a moody twin sister of The Witch (which was a genuine horror); but I found it to be mesmerising and intriguing, and a fabulously well-crafted psychological drama with trimmings of horror.",The Lighthouse,2019-11-01,7.5,148309,2019
tt7984734,8,Really well made movie. Great acting and I was really transported to another place and time. Well crafted for sure.. but in the end I'm not quite sure what the point of it all was.

tt7984734,6,"This is precisely the type of film that will garner equal amounts of unbridled praise by the arthouse diehards, as well as criticism (and likely rejection) from a lot of other viewers. My opinion lies somewhere in the middle. I give it 6 stars for the undeniably outstanding acting (obviously, Dafoe)... and Pattinson is very impressive. Something new, yes. Effective at mood-setting, check. The b&w filming, the shots, the scenery itself... even the set, the old dilapidated coastal shack, all excellent. The dynamic between the two characters is raw and real. Is it a thought-provoking free-fall into insanity? Maybe. But... there is a such a fine line between ""arthouse"", trying something different, leaving much up to subjectivity and imagination, and... just trying a bit too hard. Mermaid labia? Hmmm. But, if part of the definition of a cinematic ""success"" is evoking emotion, then mission accomplished. Total despair, pity, fear, disgust, and a general feeling of creepery, all there.",The Lighthouse,2019-11-01,7.5,148309,2019

tt7984734,6,I can't necessarily say this was a bad movie but I can say I have no idea what I just watched. The movie was shot beautifully and visually appealing in most scenes. The acting was a 10/10 for both Defoe and Patterson as they both had outstanding performances. This was a very strange film. A lot of random stuff goes on at that light house that makes you wonder if it's happening or if it's one of Patterson's delusions. This was a very different movie considering the strange aspect ratio and the old school black and white look coming back. I enjoyed The Witch which is what lead me to see this film and they were two very different movies. This was a very strange film.,The Lighthouse,2019-11-01,7.5,148309,2019
tt7984734,6,"I expected so much more from the movie, as the director's prior movie, The Witch, was an excellent film. Additionally, the trailer for this movie immediately intrigued. However, upon seeing it, I left the theater initially confused but then after realizing it wasn't worth much energy, I just accepted the reality of my reaction: disappointment. It was underwhelming. The first hour or so was intriguing and certainly set things up in an intriguing manner but what was set up was ultimately neglected in a pursuit for style and atmosphere over substance. The movie is most definitely a play at metaphors, symbolism, hidden meaning, references to seafaring myths, The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, Greek myths (a seeming melding together of Sisyphus and Prometheus), and so on but the muddled execution made me suspect that there wasn't nearly as much going on as the cinephiles and movie theorists will invent for it.Essentially, after the first hour this became narratively unclear and focused instead on repetitive fever dream scenarios and bombastic speeches and emotional conflict between the two characters - all of which were well done and well executed but only raised question marks without a clear story or message. Perhaps it is possible to decrypt it but nothing about the themes or the atmosphere or the story was compelling enough to merit the effort of seeking deeper meaning in this movie. The movie was cinematographically fantastic, well acted, well made, and so on. But the script and story failed after the first hour.",The Lighthouse,2019-11-01,7.5,148309,2019
tt7984734,3,"If you've ever taken an acting class where the instructor gives the actors some thin idea and then two actors go on about 4 times longer than is interesting--well that's the flaw in this film.The two actors are good, Pattinson better than I thought possible, maybe even great but how much drunker can you get? How much crazier can you get?That's all a good part of this story is about. There isn't any development just another scene just like the one before, two guys in a barely illuminated room getting drunk and babbling, just like the previous scene that lasted 7 minutes and just ended was.The film feels like it's 2 and a half hours long. This is a misfire from a promising director. People argued if his previous film, The Witch, was really a horror film people may argue if this is even a movie.I saw it opening night. The audience was small, two women walked out about ten minutes from the end.Neither actor really has a character to play just a type and in lessor acting hands it would have all been even worse. Around the edges of the, 2 guys in a room being drunk and crazy sequences, there is moody B and W, purposely narrow framed atmosphere, The music and sound design are well done.There are few real supernatural visuals and of these I just say, more mermaid please.I guess it's more like THE LOST WEEKEND on an island than an island based supernatural story, just don't expect much in the way of story and gobs of exposition and talk talk talk, a movie that doesn't show and just tells.It has various gross out bits that the director avoided in his first film and also lacks an ending--instead opting for film schoolish ambiguity and feels much much longer than it is. Slow and steady becomes laborious and also frankly though its visual tricks are impressive at first they really don't develop much and the lack of color also weighs the film down, though really the script is what just isn't there.It feels like it's written by the two brothers while on cocaine, lots of focus on details that don't add up, energetic over-concentration on small details and no perception of anything else. No building momentum exists to bring it all off as a story of as a feature film. A few bits of intentionally dark humor get lost in the general grime as do the few vivid Lovecraftian tentacles. Really a let down this film is.",The Lighthouse,2019-11-01,7.5,148309,2019
tt7984734,10,"Film festival sweetheart The Lighthouse is a movie that a lot of film buffs have been looking forward to. The buzz has been real since it's premiere at Cannes festival and has been my personal most anticipated movie of the year for a while now. I'm more than happy to report that this movie lived up to my expectations in every way imaginable and is probably the best movie from 2019By far the most interesting thing about this movie is it's technical aspects. The movie is shot in 35mm black and white film at a 1,19x1 aspect ratio, basically the Lighthouse is shot to look like something that came out in the 1910s. Robert Eggers and his team have done such a phenomenal job here recreating this time period. And it works asolutely perfectly beacuse not only is it fitting for the time period that the movie is set in but it also adds to the claustrophobia and the atmosphere of the setting. Alot of thought was clearly put into shot composition as every single shot in this movie is breathtaking. Seriously there is some gorgeous cinematography on display here, some shots will stay with you long after you see the movie. Whilst the film is made to look and feel like a movie from the early 1900s, it's also not afraid to implement modern elements into the film aswell. camera movements and music composition add a unique modern spice that really adds to the movies unique presentation, there is truly nothing quite like this.
With the setting and the premise, for this movie to work it it needed two actors to pull this all together. Which is where Willam Dafoe and Robert pattinson come in, who both give career best performances. Both actors are given such brilliant material that allows them to go parody level insane, but it works beutifuly for the world in which they inhabit. Dafoe especially is hamming it up to cartoon levels of parody (Which the film does address) and it's absolutely amazing. Pattinson also continues to prove himself as one of the finest actors working in the industry.Overall this is nothing short of spectacular. I truly cannot think of a single flaw. This is one of those movies that completely transcends you into its world and by the time the credits roll you will just want to go back in.",The Lighthouse,2019-11-01,7.5,148309,2019
tt7984734,3,"Both actors demonstrated excellent acting; in a way I saw it as a play rather than a feature film. Aside from the acting, the movie was boring, difficult to understand (was there anything to understand?) and confusing. I enjoy psychological thrillers, but this was not even near that. The ending gave no answers....a movie that has no proper ending or even a hint of an ending is not worth watching. Having said that, I do not recommend this movie, for me it was a waste of time.",The Lighthouse,2019-11-01,7.5,148309,2019
tt7984734,1,"I rarely go to the movies. I vastly prefer watching a film at home. It takes a lot to get me to go see something in the theater, but I made one of my infrequent trips to the local theater to see Robert Eggers' newest film, The Lighthouse. Ever since its premiere at the Cannes Film Festival, this film has been wowing critics all over the world, getting critical acclaim from everyone who saw it. The concept sounded interesting, and I enjoyed the trailer, so I decided to check it out as soon as possible.The first thing many people are mentioning, and the thing that immediately hits you when the film begins, is the aspect ratio it was filmed in. The movie is shot in a boxy format, tossing aside the usual widescreen format in favor of a much more compact frame. This offers an immediate feeling of claustrophobia and gave me hope that I was in for an exciting movie experience.Unfortunately, the atmosphere caused by the aspect ratio and the choice to shoot in black and white over color is where my praise for this movie begins and ends. I am not going to sugar coat it or go in half-way with backwards insults. To put it bluntly: I hated this movie. HATED. I hated everything about it. I hated what passed for a story. I hated the acting. I hated the actual shot composition in every way that wasn't involving the aspect ratio. I hated the damn foghorn that went off seemingly every 30 seconds for the entirety of the film's duration.When I read the buzz on this movie, all I heard about was the amazing acting, the incredible cinematography, and the excellent story. Critics and audiences alike were falling over themselves as they heaped praise on this film, calling it a masterpiece. This leads me to think one of two things has happened here: Either A- I am too stupid to understand what I saw, or B-nobody understood this movie, and didn't want to admit it, so they figured if they found it overly confusing, it must be brilliant.This movie is supposed to be a psychological thriller, following two isolated men's decent into madness, but it actually plays more like a parody of independent film. This movie is one long cliché from start to finish.Black and white? CheckBig movie star in a small movie trying to get taken seriously as more than a tween heart throb? Check.Older character actor in a prominent role? Check.Dream sequences interspersed in such a way that you can't tell what is real and what is fantasy? CheckAtmospheric background ""music"" with zero melody? CheckOpen ended, pretentious non-finale that answers zero questions and can be interpreted any number of ways by an audience too embarrassed to admit nothing they saw made any sense? Check and double check!I would give a spoiler warning, but even though I sat through this movie, I still have no clue what happened. There was a lot of yelling. Foghorns. A lot of screaming. Foghorns. Rain. Foghorns. Fighting. Foghorns. Dream sequences. Rain. Foghorns. More fighting. More foghorns. More yelling. A fight scene between Robert Pattenson and a seagull. Foghorns. Some more fighting. Rain. And for good measure, foghorns. Then a horrible ending.I have been racking my brain trying to figure out the best way to describe the experience of watching The Lighthouse and I think I have come up with the perfect way to do so. Have you ever had somebody try to describe a dream to you, but the dream made zero sense, and they barely remember it? They are rambling on, backtracking, trying to describe something that they themselves didn't understand, makes zero sense, and they don't actually remember? That painful conversation usually lasts about three minutes. Now have that conversation for an hour and forty five minutes, while a foghorn blasts in your ear over and over. That is what watching The Lighthouse is like.There are two people credited with the screenplay for this movie, but I refuse to believe an actual script exists. I have put more thought into this movie review than the screenwriters did the actual movie. It is good that the movie is so dark and everything is hard to make out, because both Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson do so much over acting, that I am convinced the scenery had actual bite marks in it. Half of the movie is so confusingly shot, I could barely tell the two actors apart. Even the rain looked overly fake. I swear if the camera panned over a few feet to the side, you would see people with buckets and sprinklers at the ready. The only person who went above and beyond in their job performance in the making of this movie was whomever was responsible for sounding the foghorn. That person deserves a special Oscar for stamina.The characters in this movie spend the majority of the story questioning their sanity, and I have to admit, I know exactly how they feel. I am highly selective in what I go to see, and as a result, I rarely see a movie I don't enjoy to some degree. Yet I absolutely hated every second of this movie. Am I that out of touch with my own tastes? Am I losing my sense of self? I no longer know what is real. Who am I? How could I have been so wrong? Why is a movie I flat out loathed getting such universal acclaim? Is there something I am missing? Have I become incapable of recognizing genius? Or are these critics just covering for the fact that they didn't understand this movie any more than anyone else in my theater did?As I left, I was thinking to myself how I had just witnessed the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. I was in stunned silence at being so wrong in thinking I would like this movie, when I overheard other people talking about the film. I felt a small measure of relief in the fact that every single one of them was talking about how terrible the movie was. I didn't hear one positive thing being said by the other movie-goers in my theater. So what did we all miss?I am left with a feeling of confusion as I try to make sense of what I saw. At first, I thought it was not believable that two men would descend into madness over a period of only a few weeks, yet this movie managed to do it to me in less than two hours, so I guess it is more believable than I initially thought. Still, just because the movie was confusing and made me question my own relationship with myself, it did not do so in the way it intended. The only way I could see Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe going so crazy so quickly is if they were able to watch themselves in this movie, like the scene in Spaceballs where Rick Moranis is watching the VHS of the movie to figure out what is going on and gets to the part of the movie he is actually doing at that time.Needless to say, I can not recommend this movie in any way. I went in excited, and left heartbroken. I thought this movie was going to be everything that I love about film making, but was instead, almost like a dark parody of it instead. This was (and I say this with all sincerity, and what I believe to be full command of my mental faculties) the worst movie I have ever seen.Foghorn.",The Lighthouse,2019-11-01,7.5,148309,2019

I dare even say that it's one of those movies that's so up its own ass and it acts like it's deep and has hidden meaning when it doesn't. I legit feel like I just wasted my 2 hours for nothing.The actors are amazing yes and some shots look fantastic, but the movie is just dull and uninteresting.I went into this movie expecting to be mindblown by it and have it stuck in my head for days after I see it.

tt7984734,4,"If a man goes crazy on a rock, but the rock is just a metaphor and the man doesn't actually exist, does it matter?It's hard to understand how or why so many people think this to be a good film. While the acting is superb, and the cinematography great, everything beyond that is a clumsy mess so full of itself that it's bursting.At its core the story is an obvious ode to Prometheus, with a side serving of identity crisis, and a possible exploration into the timeloop spectrum (Thomas and Thomas both have very similar mustaches, after all).While the actors and crew were clearly giving their all to this performance, in the end it's hard to actually care about anything that happens. Everything is so isolated and vague, that all you come away with is the feeling that nothing you just saw matters. The story is so distant from any conceptual reality that it doesn't seem worth the effort to further analyze the themes and lore that inspire it, and that's where this arthouse movie falls apart.I don't want to spoil it beyond that because while I'm critical of its reputation, the film itself is bizarre, disturbing, and hilarious enough to deserve a watch.

tt7984734,10,"Wow. Eggers follow up to The Witch knocks it out of the park. The Lighthouse is a masterful piece of art like nothing I've seen before. Following Defoe and Pattinson as they tend a Lighthouse. The film wastes no time turning into a disturbing submersion into insanity.The Lighthouse is undoubtedly an unconventional and bizarre film. Giving the viewer nothing more than two men in one location. The movie manages to pull it off masterfully. Defoe's acting is really one of, if not the strongest aspects of The Lighthouse. His scary ramblings, his facial expressions, his level of commitment to the role are all second to none. I believe so far from what I've seen he deserves the oscar for what would be Best Supporting Actor. A24 recently said they will campaign Pattinson for best actor. Make no mistake, Pattinson absolutely kills it too. However for me, Defoe is the true tour de force performance.Despite not having a conventional plot, their are some plot points and it's all this film needed to stay cohesive. The imagery in the film is very unsettling and surreal. The dialogue is expertly written and pungent. The score and the sound of The Lighthouse is another strong point, loudly ominous... it works perfectly. The cinematography is beautiful. Everything is firing on all cylinders and it creates one hell of a ride.The Lighthouse is surely a one of a kind work and one of the best psychological horror films in recent memory. It falls just short of a 10/10 masterpiece for me due some pacing issues and certain events in the film feeling meaningless and repetitive. That being said, The Lighthouse is a true achievement in cinema and currently the best of 2019 for me. I can't wait to see it again. 9.5/10.",The Lighthouse,2019-11-01,7.5,148309,2019

There's a high tension and a very uncomfortable atmosphere that even allowed some very dry humour and some very funny scenes without ruining the whole mood/feeling of the movie (like It: Chapter 2 did, for example).Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson are (of course) outstanding, but I just have to say that I'm very excited that director Robert Eggers delievered another unique cinematic experience after The Witch.",The Lighthouse,2019-11-01,7.5,148309,2019
tt7984734,3,"And the new reigning champ of biggest disappointment of the year goes to... The Lighthouse. The tall-tale about two boring men who are set out to spend four weeks stuck together in a lighthouse. End of plot summary. Even The Green Goblin and Batman can't propel this beyond Eggers' weak material, and boy do they try. On the one hand, gone are all the cheesy supernatural elements. Mostly anyway. Unfortunately, he also took out the tense drama of The Witch as well. In its place are cliche metaphors and a predictable conclusion set to drunken rants and tense music. Such tense music. If they handout out awards for scores that carried films, this would surely win it.I shouldn't be so hard on this one. This is the sort of film that people just getting into art films will surly declare a masterpiece. It's thoughtful pace, beautiful black and white cinematography, and weirdness will surely be the highlight of the year for many young cinephiles. Sadly, I was just checking my watch every ten minutes.",The Lighthouse,2019-11-01,7.5,148309,2019
tt7984734,8,"Greetings again from the darkness. The opening sequence plays like something from 1920's era cinema. The chug-chug-chug of a boat slamming against the waves of an angry sea while birds flap and chirp alongside. We hear the wind and ""feel"" the severe ocean spray. Several minutes elapse before any word is spoken. Immediately noticeable is the nearly square aspect ratio ... the rarely (these days) seen 1.19:1 frame, making the black and white images appear both surreal and ominous.All of the above makes perfect sense when we realize this is writer-director Robert Eggers' first feature film since his 2015 indie horror gem THE WITCH won dozens of festival awards. Mr. Eggers obviously has his own vision for projects, and his approach borders on experimental, eschewing conventional. He co-wrote this script with his brother Max, and evidently much was drawn from the actual journals of lighthouse keepers ... something that is evident in the vocabulary and the effects of solitude.4-time Oscar nominee Willem Dafoe stars alongside Robert Pattison as the two men charged with a 4 week assignment of tending to a lighthouse. The film is set in 1890, and Dafoe plays Thomas Wake, the epitome of a salty old sea dog, replete with bad leg, hardcore Atlantic accent, and upside down pipe. Pattinson is Ephraim Winslow, the assistant Wickie, who faces non-stop demands from Wake, and initially maintains a quietness as he goes about his duties ... what Wake calls the 'doldrums.' We learn little about either man's past. For Wake, other than knowing his previous assistant went mad, the clue is when he mentions ""13 Christmases spent at sea"" costing him a family. For Ephraim, when Wake asks, ""Tell me what's a timberman want with being a Wickie?"" we get some insight into Ephraim's desired future.Eggers has delivered the anti-buddy movie. It's a bleak, slow-motion race to insanity caused by being isolated with only one other person ... a person you aren't fond of. Only this is not a director or a film content with showing two men stuck on a storm-battered rock, as they slip towards insanity. No, we viewers are forced to experience some of these same feelings - how much of what we see is actually happening? It's mesmerizing and hypnotic, and the above-mentioned narrow screen aspect purposefully emphasizes the sense of confinement and claustrophobia.With no color and only a couple of characters ... OK, 3 if you count the mermaid ...OK, 4 if you count the seagull ... the film still manages to pound us with sensory overload. We can barely process all we are seeing, despite relatively minimal 'typical' action. The black and white images are mostly just various shades of gray, and sunshine is non-existent. Cinematographer Jarin Blaschke (THE WITCH) embraces the dreariness by allowing the fog, lanterns, candles, wind, rain, and harsh elements to become characters unto themselves. However, nothing is in sync with our two leads. Composer Mark Korven fills the many lapses in dialogue with sounds and tones we haven't heard before, yet they fit perfectly here. This is also quite likely the first film to utilize farts and foghorns in harmony.Director Eggers filmed this on Cape Forchu in Nova Scotia, and the extreme weather and less-than-welcoming terrain create quite the visuals - as do the faces of our two lead actors. Dafoe may never have chewed scenery so delightfully as he does here, and Pattinson starts slowly before delivering his best work - including a ferocious rant that is fascinating to watch and contrast to his character's first meal with Dafoe. Is this a horror film? A fantasy? Macabre comedy? There is simply no way to describe this other than bizarre. It's truly miserable cinema, and I loved every minute of it.",The Lighthouse,2019-11-01,7.5,148309,2019

This film must have taken a physical toll on the actors, knowing Nova Scotia's harsh conditions, & it was mesmerizing to watch onscreen.

tt7984734,NA,"I went to the opening night in my area - the theater was full. About 15mins into the show, I realized what I was getting into. Only small squarish portion of the screen was used, there were only going to be 2 actors, I could understand only 40% of the dialog, the characters are weird but not interesting and it's very, very slow.I could see people clearing out of the theater the moment it looked like it was over. I was one of them - I couldn't wait to get out.The main thing to know is that even though it's listed as ""horror"" (and in some listings sci-fi / fantasy) ... it's an art film. This means it's generally unconventional, experimental and geared at a niche audience. A lot of times such movies will capture critical praise but be unappealing to mass audiences.That's what's going on with this movie. It's bizarre, psychological, atmospheric and if it happens to grab you - intense. Otherwise, it will be a massively disappointing. If you saw ""The Witch"", Egger's other key movie, you'll understand. People went in expecting a typical horror movie, but were instead given a slow, shakespearean-like drama with complex language and minimal, slow scares.For me, the problem with this movie is that I didn't care about either of the characters. Neither seemed relatable or engaging. If anything, it was uncomfortable to watch them. The story seemed more about madness than anything spooky. If it had been a short film - it might have been palatable, but not in its current form.Unless you liked ""The Witch"" or are into artsy / experimental movies, definitely be forewarned and eliminate your expectations.

There was a lot of laughter in my screening.Woody Harrelson is as awesome as he always is, and is on top form, its always nice to see Emma Stone playing a fun role, her parts down so serious lately!! Yes, i know she is an Oscar winner and she should be playing the best parts she can get, its just nice to see her having fun in a role again, as she is a good comedic actress, I love some of her facial expressions.Now, when I hear the name Abigail Breslin, its always the little girl from My Sisters Keeper and Little Miss Subshine who pops into my head, I always forget the has grown up!! Even though I though i though she was great in Maggie with Arnie. She is fun here too, although her character is more of a plot device than anything else. A bit of a waste of her talents.But it was Zoey Deutch who steals the movie for me. She was such an unexpected, delightful surprise. Playing the dumb blonde is a hard act to do well without being annoying!! Generally outside of one or two performances I hate the cliche of a dumb blonde character, but she nails it.

tt1560220,1,"I saw Zombieland the first movie. And it was fresh, funny, it moved along at a nice clip. It was fluffy entertainment. The characters were personable and made me care about them and made me root for them. I really enjoyed the original Zombieland movie. I saw it several times as a matter of fact.
BUT... Zombieland 2? What the heck happened? It's as if the characters are coasting on the success of the first. They don't even try to be interesting. They spend the entire first half doing nothing. It was dead space. Yeah, pun intended. Nothing happened. It was like the Seinfeld of the movie theater, the show about nothing, this was the movie about nothing... but unlike Seinfeld which was funny, Zombieland 2 was BORING.
The characters banter back and forth and back and forth and back and forth...Then they split up for the dumbest of reasons. It's as if they really didn't know what to do with themselves, so just split up and pretend like they don't mean anything to each other. Then suddenly oh, they do mean something to each other. Then more banter. Then a ditsy character joins in and she spends her time repeating herself. Yes, she's brainless. Okay. I got it. Please, stop beating me over the head with that!
I just think the writers had no idea what to do with these characters and just put them in a random pointless scenario just to tell the audience, ""look! remember these funny characters? yeah, laugh at them for no reason."" They all became so annoying that I actually walked out of the theater and asked for a refund, but they don't give refunds so I got a free ticket instead so I'm not too upset.
I was SO looking forward to this movie. I relished seeing the characters again. I wanted to laugh out loud and have a good time. Instead I yawned, I felt sleepy. I got bored out of my skull and I walked out.

tt1560220,2,"Maybe my standards are a bit unrealistic, but if you can't do at least was well as the first movie, don't make the second. Zombieland 2 is one of those movies that makes me wish someone had invented a way to unmake a movie--as if it had never happened, erased from the universal consciousness. Like the third ""The Mummy"" movie or that last Indiana Jones with that nutcase Shia Labeouf. Or any of the Terminator movies after the second one. Yes, this movie was that disappointing. Nothing fresh, nothing new, just a pale imitation of the first one. Everyone seemed like they were phoning it in.
And how believable is it that the group dynamic hadn't changed at all in TEN YEARS? The two lovebirds hadn't progressed at all. The kid had obviously grown up, but not into someone likeable, rather into a fat, sulky, slightly stupid woman. Her sister looked like she was in her forties, so tired and creased. And why do these sisters not have the same name? Did they grow up and live in different cities before the zombie apocalypse? If not, then they should both have the same city name. Columbus has lost his quirk and Tallahassee just screams profanities and breaks stuff a lot. No funny here. No quirky here. Not even the classification of different zombie types was particularly funny.
One of the more unlikeable plot points was the inclusion of the Tallahassee and Columbus clones. What was their point? They could have been removed from the movie altogether and it wouldn't have mattered. Did Luke Wilson just beg to be in the movie and they said ""Okay, we'll make up this stupid, pointless character who only lasts about fifteen minutes. Ham it up and make the most of your time. There, you happy?""

It was wild, fresh and most inportantly fun thanks in large part to a great cast that made the experience memorable. Zombieland: Double Tap, brought back the entire to send them on a new adventure but sadly, the story leaves a lot more to be desired.This zombie fairy tale starts of well describing how the world has evolved in the past 10 years and the changes that came with it but in the grand scheme of things, its a pale shadow when compared to the original. They did bring in some new elements and characters that do a decent job of fitting into the narrative but ultimately, the movie fails to grasp the lightheartedness and energy of its predecessor.I am a harsh critic when it comes to zombie films but here I understand that realism should go out the window to allow the movie to be a comedy. They doubled on the jokes but half of them ended up feeling either forced or stale which prevented the movie from having a smooth flow. The cast makes this movie worth the watch as it feels like they haven't changed since 2009 making it a decent sequel to be honest, Zombieland should have been left as a standalone cult classic.Movies.shmovies on Instagram",Zombieland: Double Tap,2019-10-18,6.7,142992,2019

The jokes are hilarious but become stale as the movie goes on, and a lot they overuse or just become redundant, like the dumb blonde was funny but gets overplayed and annoying to the point where it loses the comedy, same for the little girls love interest, and it's almost like the director said we need everyone to have a love interest... it could have been much more interesting... the only interesting love interest is woody And the new actress who I think is badass. Also Jessie eisenberg Emma stone are cool and the chemistry between the drama works, it's just the blond becomes so annoying and ruins it and them getting together again just feels unearned and cliche. The movie packs a punch with everything it has. The scene where the have two twins was funny and a lot of jokes do land. The final act is very dumb and so half assed. I feel like the original had a faster ending too but it made it work within that little time and it was a shorter film than this one, however it managed to make the little time work. This movie just feels like it wants to wrap it up... and the scene where the monster truck comes in is badass however I can't ignore how dumb and out of nowhere it is for her character and PERFECT timing mind you... a 6/10 is not bad. I wouldn't mind or care for watching this movie again but if I watch Zombieland I wouldn't mind putting this on after to get a few laughs and fall asleep later.

tt1560220,1,"Too long to create between the two films. There is nothing new here. Same dry comedy that's set up miles before the punch line and visible for twice as many miles. It's just undeed and completely unnecessary 2 hours. Z Nation was infinately better in humor and story with a quarter the budget.
Skip it.",Zombieland: Double Tap,2019-10-18,6.7,142992,2019
tt1560220,7,"The original Zombieland (2009) was something of a sleeper hit, earning over $100 million against a $24 million budget, becoming the most financially successful zombie most ever made, until it was surpassed by the asinine World War Z (2013). Smart, funny, and self-aware, it didn't take itself too seriously, and it had bucket-loads of heart, but it was hardly a film crying out for a sequel. And as time passed, it seemed more and more unlikely such a sequel would happen. However, after a decade in development hell, Zombieland: Double Tap has arrived, and boy is it one of the most unnecessary sequels I've seen in quite some time. However, as unnecessary as it is, it's also extremely enjoyable. It doesn't do a whole lot that wasn't in the original, but the irreverent sense of humour, fourth wall breaks, sharp character interactions, and, most importantly, shedloads of charm are all present and accounted for. Directed by Ruben Fleischer (who helmed the original) and written by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick (who wrote the original), along with Dave Callaham, Double Tap may not take too many risks, but it's a fine companion piece.10 years after the events in the first film, the quartet is still together and still getting on one another's nerves - there's the neurotic but sweet Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg doing his Jessie Eisenberg thing), the crass but caring Tallahassee (a wonderfully acerbic Woody Harrelson), the sarcastic Wichita (a dead-pan Emma Stone) and the laidback Little Rock (Abigail Breslin doing a lot with the little she's given). As we meet them, they're in the process of taking up residence in the White House - Columbus and Wichita are still a couple, but recently, she's started to wonder if perhaps their relationship is more important to him than it is to her; Little Rock is now a young woman who resents the fact that Tallahassee still treats her like she's 11; and Tallahassee, for his part, hasn't changed an iota. After Columbus proposes to Wichita (using the Hope Diamond), she and Little Rock skip town, but she returns a month later, telling the others that Little Rock ditched her and headed to a supposed zombie-free commune. And so the trio reluctantly set out to find her. Along the way, we're introduced to Madison (Zoey Deutch, who completely steals the film), a millennial bimbo who's been holed up in walk-in freezer; Berkeley (Avan Jogia), a peace-loving hippie; Nevada (Rosario Dawson), a tough-as-nails Elvis aficionado; and Albuquerque (Luke Wilson) and Flagstaff (Thomas Middleditch), who are eerily similar to Tallahassee and Columbus (the reveal of which was spoiled by the trailer). There's also a new breed of zombie, which is faster, stronger, and more intelligent than the regular kind, and which can only be killed with multiple head-shots.And that's about it as far as the plot goes.Although 10 years have passed and the zombie movie landscape is very different, one of the sequel's most successful elements is that next to nothing has changed; in essence, it acknowledges the gap precisely by ignoring it. So, Columbus's opening voiceover specifically refers to the long break as he thanks us for choosing Double Tap when there is such ""a wide choice of zombie entertainment"" and Madison tells Tallahassee his catchphrase is ""very 2009"", but the film as a whole feels as if it was shot immediately after the original. Of course, this is important insofar as in the universe of the franchise, the last decade has been very different to the last decade of our reality, so the filmmakers can't layer in too many contemporary references - although Columbus does mention how ""unrealistic"" The Walking Dead comics are, there's a hilarious deconstruction of the concept of Uber, and there's a subtle allusion to Trump when Wichita sarcastically tells Tallassee he'd have brought ""a real dignity"" to the office of the presidency.This factors into the performances as well, insofar as Columbus, Tallahassee, and Wichita are all broadly similar to how they were 10 years ago. Little Rock has changed significantly, but that's as much to do with the fact that she was a child in the original and is now a young woman. This lack of character development may sound like a bad thing, but really, the familiarity of the characters and their group dynamic has its own inherent charm, we welcome it because it's familiar, with the cast essentially doing the same things they did in the original. Speaking of performances, Zoey Deutch completely owns every scene she's in. Sure, the character is clichéd as all hell and, on paper, she should be all kinds of annoying, but that she isn't, is a testament to Deutch's warm performance, finding genuine pathos amidst the perpetually peppy and cheerful high-energy ditz. She also has great chemistry with the original cast, especially Harrelson. In fact, all of the new actors have terrific chemistry, which is nice to see insofar as effortless chemistry was one of the hallmarks of the original.In terms of problems, as mentioned, the film doesn't do a whole lot that wasn't in the original - the characters, the narrative beats, the group dynamic, the humour; all are pretty much the same as the original, and for some, this will certainly be an issue. Indeed, as much as I enjoyed the film, I would have liked to see it take more risks (there's certainly nothing here to rival the inspired Bill Murray cameo). Because of this blanket similarity, there is a sense in which the sequel isn't really its own thing, it's defined primarily by what the original did rather than forging its own path, and a lot of the meta-humour only works if you know the original. Another problem is that it fails to do much with an interesting set-up, which sees women chaffing against traditional gender roles and the identities conferred on them by men. Once the gang end up on the road, this theme is pretty much forgotten (even with the introduction of Nevada, who seems more like a man's idea of what a tough woman should be than her own person). There are also more than a few clichés, primarily in relation to Madison (as blond a character as you'll ever meet) and the one-note Berkeley (a weed-smoking gun-hating hippie, who is literally introduced by way of a sitar on the soundtrack).Zombieland: Double Tap is undemanding and doesn't completely justify its existence, but it also does justice to the original, and never for one second does it take itself seriously. The effortlessness with which it slots into the original's groove is either funny in its own right or poor writing, depending on your perspective, but the film is smart enough to know and acknowledge that it feels slightly out of place in 2019. And if a little of the spark has been lost, the warmth, the characters, the jokes, and the playfulness more than make up for it.",Zombieland: Double Tap,2019-10-18,6.7,142992,2019

tt8106534,1,"This is my first review ever on IMDB. And I only writing it to warn others.In short. DO NOT WATCH IT. This is the worst movie I have ever seen. It doesn't make sense at all. The Dialogues might as well been written by Zuckerbot himself, based at a belief that this is how real humans talk. People doesn't make long sarcastic jokes when being in a high speed car chase and bullets flying. All characters have no regards what so ever to what's happening around them. Like they don't realise that they are about to die at any second. When you watch movie like Bad Boys, they are shouting, cursing in midst of the action. These characters do nothing like this - their behaviour is alien-like.Continuing.The timeline jumps back and forth in a mind-boggling way. A rear view mirror is lost upon a collision with a truck, only to be respawned a second later when the movie is cut to a different camera-view. and that's after the first 10 minuets.Still continuing. There is no real chemistry between the actors nor ANY logical explanation to why the other characters choses to follow Ryan Reynolds lead. Ryan Reynolds character is multi billionaire whose technical inventions are in all modern electronic products, yet in the movie he is completely unknown to the world. Basically, he is a male model version of Elon Musk gone Robin Hood. The Actions scenes are great though. Car chases, fights, shoot-outs are all excellent made. However, somebody please tell me why you would need to hire an acrobat for your super-secret swat team? If the movie didn't try so hard to be serious I would have laughed through it all. But it just becomes so ridiculous when the same Acrobat first need to grab his skateboard and grind a rail to get into position so he can shoot the driver in the chasing car, instead of just stopping and shooting up the car straight away.Anybody rating this movie 6 or higher must have been on drugs when watching it, and I wish I had been too.",6 Underground,2019-12-13,6.1,142257,2019

tt8106534,5,"This is a typical modern Michael Bay film, it's all style over substance. Leave your brain at the door and you might enjoy it, I wish I did but I didn't.I'll give you a quick example of what to expect while trying to explain why I couldn't bring myself to enjoy this film. Opening scene is a 15 minute car chase through a city. Firstly, the vehicle they choose to use as a getaway vehicle is a bright neon green Alfa Romeo that sticks out in the crowd like a sore thumb driving a bright neon green sports car would. Why would anyone choose this as a getaway vehicle instead of a car with a paint job a bit more inconspicuous I hear you ask? Because it's a Michael Bay film that's why, and it's all about style remember? Secondly, every car and bike that crashes during the chase produces enough sparks and fire to rival the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics, plus the sounds they make when they crash are the most ridiculous Transformers sounding noises I have ever heard outside of a Transformers movie. And lastly, the bright neon green sports car gets scratched up by another vehicle and the drivers side mirror gets knocked off, but the next shot it's back on again, then it's off, then it's on, and it switches between broken and not broken a dozen or so times before someone decided that for continuity sake we better just stick to one or the other and thankfully they chose to go with the broken one. Pretty sloppy filmmaking really, and this is all in the opening 15 - 20 minutes, and unfortunately I can't turn my brain off enough to enjoy a film like that.Other things that I didn't like about the film, the overall story is laughable and makes absolutely no sense at all, and when I say no sense I'm not being hyperbolic I mean it makes no sense, from the people he chooses to join his team to the way he recruits them to the missions they do it's all so ludicrous, if you allow yourself to question its logic for even one second then the entire thing falls apart. It's got your typical Michael Bay hit or miss humor along with other ""Bayerisms"" that we've come to expect from him, like the over use of quick cuts during action sequences, low angle shots of women in short skirts, so much slow motion that if the slow motion parts were at normal speed I reckon the film would be about half an hour shorter than it is, and scenes that are meant to be emotional and pull on your heart strings but because every character has no depth to them they end up having about as much emotional impact as a carpet cleaning commercial does.What I did like. CGI people getting hit by cars and caught in explosions and thrown around and stuff, it was completely overused but the first few times it happened it looked quite good, especially people getting side swiped by vehicles. Some of the bad guy kills were well done. I enjoyed most of the banter between Ryan Reynolds and the non Ryan Reynolds actors, it was funny and was just Ryan Reynolds being your typical Ryan Reynolds which is good if you like Ryan Reynolds and I like Ryan Reynolds.

With a budget and a cast like this, one would expect that an extremely basic cinematographic concept of CONSISTENCY would be a priority..... many slight inconsistencies have been noticed in mainstream, even award winning films before.

The Architect of the Szechenyi Chain Bridge in Budapest committed suicide because he neglected to think of designing the lions with tongues, the least the composer of this ostrosity could do is issue a public apology for ruining possible award winning stunts, special effects, acting and a great story line with his lack of expertise in scene composition.

Nothing makes any sense at all. Some of the visuals are stunning, but after every chasing car is destroyed a new one simply appears out of nowhere, like some kind of computer game. Pedestrians are mown down or shot without a second thought, meaning that it is impossible to relate to, or care about, the lead characters from the very start. As yet another car was destroyed in slow motion, and the chase went literally nowhere, my son turned to me and asked what on earth was going on.

tt2066051,10,"Taron Egerton's portrayal of Elton John is superb and only heightened by the producers allowing Taron to sing his own versions of many of Elton John's classic hits. It would be impossible to capture all aspects of Elton John's life in the 2 hours provided in this musical/biographical film, so instead the producer/writer/director concentrated on Elton's early childhood which helped shape his destiny when he first met his partner in song writing the great Bernie Taupin played by Jamie Bell.There were far too many other excellent performances from the supporting cast members to mention them all but I have to mention two in particular who were top notch. Bryce Dallas Howard plays Elton's irresponsible (wife cheating) mother, and Richard Madden who plays John Reid one of Elton's early but serious lovers remained Elton's manager for decades after their sexual relationship ended. Both of these actors added a lot to the films depth in the one area that focused on Elton's tormented soul and led him to binge drinking and pill popping which is the area this film reflected.I hope we don't have to wait for Elton John to pass away (God forbid) before some producer realizes that Elton John and Bernie Taupin whose lifestyles and personalities are so diametrically opposite that they deserve their life stories to be developed into a (minimum) ten (10) hour TV Mini-Series to cover a heck of a lot of both of these musical genius's personal lives as well as their successes with their musical portfolios.Rocketman is well worth seeing and rates a perfect 10 out of 10 in my version of Elton John's quasi autobiography book.",Rocketman,2019-05-31,7.3,141979,2019
tt2066051,7,"It's going to get very mixed reviews. I predict many will love it, and many will revile it. I was caught somewhere in the middle. Without giving any actual spoilers away, consider this:1. If you absolutely HATE musicals, save your money. This is the John/Taupin equivalent of a Rodgers & Hammerstein. It is not presented as a straightforward biopic in the same manner as BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY.
2. Much as I love Elton John, this ""rock & roll fantasy"" of his life treads a little too far into campy territory for me, with 2, maybe 3 very (thankfully) brief moments in the film that can only be described as cringeworthy. (""Oh, come on, guys--seriously?"" moments.) There were times when I genuinely felt this was going to end up as the Ken Russell version of TOMMY for the new millennium.
3. Never, at any point in the film, is Paul Buckmaster mentioned or acknowledged. This infuriated me! For those who don't already know: in the early days of EJ's career, Paul was the orchestrator who provided EJ with the BEAUTIFUL, lush string accompaniments that added so much to EJ's early music (classic example: EJ's soundtrack to the 1971 French film, FRIENDS) and, IMHO, could have been a big player in his success as a burgeoning artist, firmly introducing/establishing The Elton John ""Sound."" He SHOULD have been a part of this film--even a small one, if deemed necessary--but for him to be utterly omitted from the story mystifies me. Maybe someone in the know can enlighten me on this.These 3 things, however, are about my only problems with the film. Credit must be given where it's due:1. Taron Egerton is actually pretty amazing. Some might see his acting as occasionally over the top, but frankly and for all we know, maybe EJ really did act that ""extremely"" at times, considering his anger issues. His singing, most of the time, is virtually spot-on, catching EJ's lilting singing style quite well.
2. The supporting cast:
Jamie Bell (Bernie Taupin), Bryce Dallas Howard , Richard Madden (EJ's agent & self-centered 1st lover), Stephen Graham (Dick James), Tate Donovan (L.A.'s Troubador Club manager Doug Weston), Gemma Jones (Ivy, EJ's grandmother, I think...? Or friend of the family?) & Steven Mackintosh (EJ's cold, uncaring father)...and all others in the film, essentially faultless. ESPECIALLY Jamie's portrayal of Bernie. Wow.
3. You can't really find fault with the staging and choreography of the musical numbers. Very professionally done.

My criticisms aside (and we all know what they say about opinions), it really comes down to this: if you're a fan--and especially a DEDICATED fan, like me, who's followed him from his humble beginnings in America in the summer of 1970--go see it.

tt2066051,8,"Although classical music and opera is more my cup of tea/forte, that has never stopped me from having always admired Elton John and loving most of his songs. ""Your Song"", ""Something About the Way You Look Tonight"", ""I'm Still Standing"" and pretty much all the songs in 'The Lion King' are especially great, one of the few exceptions being ""Crocodile Rock"". He is/was also a quite interesting man, both stage persona and personal life, and the period that is primarily focused on is a very compelling one and worthy of being told on film.'Rocketman' was not a perfect film, but on the most part it was thoroughly enjoyable and at its best dazzlingly executed when seeing it in the cinema earlier this year. As far as films released in 2019 goes, 'Rocketman' is to me in the better half. Even if accuracy and the chronology can be called into question, it still makes John and his personal life, detailing his childhood, early career and how it came to be and the troubled period of his career, quite fascinating. As well as being worthy of a lot of admiration in its own right.Not everything works. For my liking, the last twenty minutes or so are executed too tidily.While John and Bernie Taupin are well rounded and fully realised characters, the other characters, despite being well acted by particularly Bryce Dallas Howard, felt like underdeveloped caricatures (i.e. the parents' cold behaviour towards Reggie not being explained).However, 'Rocketman' has so many things working in its favour and more so than the bad. First and foremost, Taron Egerton. A totally committed and quite brilliant performance full of confidence, swagger, flair, subtlety and nuance, not to mention a great singing voice, treating John with respect without impersonating him. The scene where he opens up to his mother and his reaction to her cold response was heart-breaking in particular. Jamie Bell is the other performance worthy of note and the relationship between John and Taupin is handled beautifully, with the right amount of intensity but also taste. One can tell how well they clicked and feel their mutual affection and it really drives the film and at times the heart of it.It looks great too, beautifully photographed and John's flamboyant costumes are a sight to behold, one of the bigger examples being that unlike-anything-you've-seen-before one in the therapy. The songs are as magnificent as one expects and staged with a lot of brio and confidence without being overblown. The very moving ""Your Song"", performance and the understated staging, being a big standout in this regard, another powerful part being with what is done with the opening of ""Yellow Brick Road"", done so truthfully and mirroring what is going on at that present moment without spelling it out too much and showing how much Taupin cares for John. Heck, the film even manages to make ""Crocodile Rock"" tolerable in one of the film's more exuberant moments.The script manages to be both entertaining and sincere, underneath all the flashiness there is depth too. There may be conventional moments in the story (a lot of biopics though are like that), but the scenes showing off John's unique showmanship are difficult to look away from and the story detailing John's troubled personal life at the time is powerful. A great job is done showing who John is, what he is and how his mind worked when dealing with troubles and when he was writing and performing. Dexter Fletcher's direction is adept.Summing up, a very, very good and often great film that just misses out on being brilliant. 8/10",Rocketman,2019-05-31,7.3,141979,2019
tt2066051,8,He was AMAZING in the spirit of an fabulous Elton John biopic musical.... and Jamie Bell was awesome.. as usual!,Rocketman,2019-05-31,7.3,141979,2019
tt2066051,10,"I want to start by saying that I really struggle to sit through longer films, I get restless and my attention wavers (a little sad I know, but it is what it is). When I left the cinema I couldn't believe the running time - including adverts etc I'd sat through 2h30 without even thinking about the time once. I was completely engrossed!
Taron Egerton, alongwith his co stars perform excellently in this fantasy based musical, taking you through the highs and lows of Elton Johns earlier life. It's a real rollercoaster experience, I loved it!
There were many moments which made me smile of bought a tear to my eye for different reasons, I'll name a couple of my favourites. Elton arrives in America and performs Crocodile Rock. There's so much passion in his performance and then comes this euphoric, floating fantasy scene, it's so beautiful and a great piece of cinematography which immerses you and makes you feel like you are there in that room. I also loved the way Elton and Bernie's friendship was shown, it was so lovely to watch. There's a really touching scene where Elton is playing his piano, creating music to accompany the lyrics to Your Song. Bernie is upstairs shaving, yet is drawn to the dining room to listen to Elton bring his song to life. Elton's singing the lyrics and keeps looking over to Bernie, seemingly singing it to Bernie platonically, as a love song. You see a real bond between the pair of them.
One scene that got me the most was after Elton had tried to commit suicide, they showed him being rushed to hospital which once he arrived there was a routine in which he was treated and prepared by everyone around him to perform on stage immediately as he forces a smile. It just showed how much he suffered and how money came first, it was really poignant. Again, a beautiful piece of work.
There's so much more to talk about, such as the relationships between him and his mum/dad/new manager come lover and how they were all equally as cold and callous. Or the scenes in which Elton has visions of his younger self, comforting a younger Elton at the end of the film with a hug - all he ever wanted. However we'd be here all day!
I truly adored this film and it's definitely one to watch on the big screen. It bought out so many emotions and that's what I think a film should do. So glad I've seen it and have recommended it to everyone who's mentioned it!",Rocketman,2019-05-31,7.3,141979,2019
tt2066051,10,"There's a moment during the first half hr of Rocketman when Reggie is sitting at the piano in his robe. He looks at Taupin's lyrics and composes ""Your Song"".. His grandmother (who seems to be the only person who loved this lonely child) comes into the living room, sits down and then does something so beautiful it made me cry. She puts her hand to her chin and gazes in awe at what her grandson has produced. By this one gesture the director shows us what a genius Elton John was in his heyday. It's an overwhelming moment. I think even Taron himself may not realize just how great he is in this movie. It's a cliché to say in a biopic that ""he becomes"" the character he portrays. But Taron Egerton overcomes the cliché. He is breathtaking in this.",Rocketman,2019-05-31,7.3,141979,2019
tt2066051,9,"I have been waiting for weeks to the premier and Taron's performance blowed me away. I can't tell it was going for a movie about Elton John or going to a premier of a concert where Taron singing and performing and telling his life story from the screen (or from the stage cause it's a premier). His voice is precious, is emotional and is skillful. He got that powerful voice yet that soulful and soft that I am sure that he is the right person, the PERFECT person for those songs and for this film. Such a perfect actor, with a gifted voice.
His acting was outstanding and his eyes told things. I can felt his thoughts and feelings, his sadness, disapointment, his emptyness. Just, breathtaking.
And Jamie Bell did great, Richard Madden also, such a wonderful compilation of these three talented and professional actors.
Love their charisma and their chemistry together. Thank you very much for a great movie. Really enjoyed it.",Rocketman,2019-05-31,7.3,141979,2019
tt2066051,4,"I've been an Elton John fan most of my life. My love for the music of Elton and Bernie literally shaped who I am. So I REALLY wanted to love this movie but I left the theater irritated and disappointed.My biggest gripes were:
1.) Some of the musical numbers were corny and out of character (e.g. young Elton dancing through the streets, acting tough and singing ""Saturday"". The young Elton John actors/singers were not very good either.
2.) The ""fantasy"" aspects and creative liberties taken to distort facts were annoying. For example, the scene at the Troubadour. It was corny having Elton and the audience flying but I get that the filmmakers wanted to communicate that the concert was a surreal, life changing evening for everyone there. What made me MAD is that he was playing Crocodile Rock! That was absurd. He and Bernie didn't even write that until '72. Plus, that song is NOT why people would have been blown away with him performance. It's a catchy little ditty that got great airplay but is not one of the songs that make Elton & Bernie great. The real set list for the Troubadour was songs like ""Your Song"", ""Border Song"", ""Take Me to the Pilot"", ""Burn Down the Mission"". That's the amazing stuff he played that night that rocked people's worlds. Not radio pop ""Crocodile Rock"". I don't see how any real Elton John can be happy with that gross distortion of facts. How about him playing part of ""Sad Songs"" for Dick James in 1969? What? That song, one of their worst commercial pop songs, was written in '83. Decades after that scene. Do the filmmaker's think we are stupid? That's not fantasy - that's just wrong!
3.) The majority of the movie was about Elton's struggles with drug/alcohol abuse, sexuality/relationships, and Mommy & Daddy issues. While it was interesting to learn about him as a person, other than some great scenes about his early days writing with Bernie, there was almost nothing about the music and how it was created. The fact that he and Elton and his band (Davey Johnstone, Nigel Olsson, Dee Murray, Ray Cooper and others) recorded dozens of great albums in cooperation with producer Gus Dudgeon and arranger Paul Buckmaster and that the band performed thousands of concerts was completely omitted from the film. In fact, the movie suggested that Elton didn't enjoy performing concerts. Like the only reason he was there was because his manager propped him up and forced him onstage. Really? Elton must have spent a huge amount of time writing, recording and performing during the first decade of his career. Was he really a wreck who was constantly wasted and feeling sorry for himself the whole time? Were there no happy moments writing music, in the recording studio, onstage? If not then I feel I have wasted my time being a fan all these years. I thought he actually liked the music but the movie suggested that once he became famous it was all about sex, drugs and depression.Were there things I liked? Sure. I really enjoyed the depiction of the early days in Elton and Bernie's relationship and particularly loved the scene with Elton writing the music to ""Your Song"". The Elton/Bernie relationship was well represented throughout the movie and the acting/singing of Taron Egerton was superb. Jamie Bell was fantastic. It made me like and admire Bernie even more than I already did. The recreation of scenes like Elton's childhood home, the Troubadour, Dodger Stadium, etc. were really well done with a ton of attention to detail. Which made it even more irritating that the filmmakers thought it was OK to distort other facts like claiming the Elton's last name was inspired by a picture of John Lennon. Sure, that would have been nice but they rewrote history. Elton has documented that it was because he liked Long John Baldry. Why change well documented facts? That's not being ""fantastical"" - that's just lying.",Rocketman,2019-05-31,7.3,141979,2019
tt2066051,7,"First things first, Elton John being one of the most famous artists in the world, with a career of about half a century and 300 million albums sold, a biopic was then more than legitimate and was even eagerly awaited. This film is conceived like a musical based on the songs and the life of Elton John, from the 50s to the early 80s, the selected songs being representative of the manifold events of his life, the ups (his life as an accomplished artist mainly) and the downs (his whole private life according to the movie), since his childhood during which he quickly turns out to be a natural born musician until his first sentimental disappointments and the first cures of detoxification (alcohol, drug, ... and tutti quanti). The movie ends with the punchy « I'm still standing », song written in 1983 after a bad patch and foreshadowing a frantic recovery of his life, the lyrics being written by his friend Bernie Taupin.One of my favorite scenes among many others is the meeting at the Royal Academy of Music, with the third movement of the Sonata Piano No. 11 by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart played twice. I do not know if it's true but, if so, this child is ingeniously bluffing!The costumes are superb and the actors are fabulous. The realization is ingenious especially with the appropriate and relevant insertion of the songs in the film, like in a musical. As a synthesis: 7/8 of 10.",Rocketman,2019-05-31,7.3,141979,2019
tt2066051,8,"Really good biopic, different to what I thought it would be, Taron Egerton was awesome , loved how the songs were integrated in film, give it a go you won't be disappointed!",Rocketman,2019-05-31,7.3,141979,2019
tt2066051,6,"*I give it 6.5/10**This is LONG. I have a lot of thoughts*To start off, I'm not much of a fan of musicals - other than a select few that I've loved since childhood. And I'm also not a fan of the fantasy genre. But I wanted to watch this and form my own opinion of it because I am a massive fan of Bohemian Rhapsody, and Rocketman has been compared to death to it, so I wanted to give it a fair chance and see what all the fuss was about. I'm going to review it in sections to make reading it a bit easier. It's very long, especially where I compare it to Bohemian. (Although I adore Bohemian, I do wish that some things were done differently, but it doesn't keep me awake at night like it clearly does for some people.)TARON: His acting was great! I found that it was even better in the second half when the storyline turned darker & more dramatic. I don't really know much about Elton John and haven't seen much archival footage of him, but from reviews, it sounds like Taron had Elton's mannerisms down and really inhabited his character. Also, I gotta say...Taron's voice is beautiful. It has an interesting quirkiness to it at times but he can also belt out when necessary.CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT: Considering this movie is based around Elton's issues with addiction and self-hate, I felt like we didn't get to see an in depth build up of his inner turmoil. It kind of seemed rushed, like certain people treated him poorly and he was frustrated/hurt and then suddenly he was an addict. I wasn't emotionally invested in that aspect of the story, which is its core focal point. As for other characters, some were very underdeveloped and their impact on Elton didn't have much of an impact on me.SCRIPT: There were some cringy moments where I found the writing was blatantly weak/awkward.EDITING/FLOW: It made the story feel disjointed at times. Sometimes I felt like the transitions from regular scenes to musical scenes (and vice versa) were clever and flowed well, and sometimes they didn't and felt messy. This is also where some of the fantasy moments just didn't work for me.COMPARISONS TO BOHEMIAN & RAMI: 1) One thing I think is super unfair is how people are using praising Taron for doing his own singing as an opportunity to throw shade at Rami for not singing in Bohemian. First of all, Rami actually did sing. He took singing lessons and ""sang at the top of his lungs every day"" (a direct quote from him). For the people who didn't pay attention, you could see his neck and throat muscles flexing during the performance scenes. And then in the editing room they blended Freddie's voice into his with the result being mostly Freddie that came through. Second, no one can replicate Freddie Mercury's unique four-octave range, which is probably the best voice in all of rock history. Rami simply didn't have a good enough voice to pull off a convincing performance of a rock legend, whereas Taron already had the gift of a great voice BEFORE Rocketman. It's not as if he learned to sing for this movie. That was an advantage Taron had when getting this role, but it doesn't mean that Rami has now become less worthy of winning his Oscar. I've seen a lot of user & critic reviews saying ""if Rami could win an Oscar for lip-syncing then Taron is more deserving because he actually sang"". An actor's performance in a music movie is about more than just the voice. Both Rami and Taron's roles were about immersing themselves fully into the person they were portraying through mannerisms, body language, overall essence, etc. Think of it this way, if Taron sang but he didn't deliver a convincing performance in the acting department, the singing aspect wouldn't have mattered.. so the reverse can also be true and was the case for Rami...his actual voice wasn't audible to us on screen but his acting was great and he delivered a convincing performance in other ways.2) People have slammed Bohemian for having inaccuracies in timelines and facts... well Rocketman does too. Both movies took creative license in order to compress 20+ years into 2 hours. I don't get why people couldn't handle that when it came to Bohemian but can seem to overlook that for Rocketman. These movies aren't documentaries, they are products of Hollywood and the entertainment industry.3) Considering things I read in reviews about the ""level of gayness"", and its R-rating, I expected to see some pretty graphic stuff. But that just wasn't the case. I live in Canada and we have a less strict rating system here. It's been rated 14A, which is basically a step above PG-13 for Americans. There are a few scenes that had some passionate but short-lived making out, a sex scene that cut away before showing any actual sex, an oral sex scene that didn't show anything, a gay orgy musical scene, and flamboyant outfits. And Bohemian had a few make outs, a post-""one night stand"" scene, a gay club scene, a drag scene, and flamboyant outfits. The biggest difference to me is that Rocketman is intentionally very flashy, which is already a major component of the musical genre. And it's a gay musical... Of course there will be excess! And there was, but just not as much as I expected. Freddie's risqué lifestyle wasn't front and centre of Bohemian, but it was purposely made that way. Both these movies had different approaches & intentions. Bohemian focused more on Freddie as a musician, who struggled with personal issues on the side, while Rocketman focused on the inner demons that followed young Elton from childhood, right through to his journey as a musician.The fact that Elton is alive and was involved in the movie making process was an advantage for Rocketman, but Bohemian didn't have that luxury with Freddie. I think the writers of Bohemian felt a duty to Freddie to not get caught up with the exposing of his darker side (sex/drugs) but to instead preserve his legacy. He was harassed by the press for his entire career over his flamboyancy and sexuality, and he died at a time when being gay still wasn't accepted, so I think that respect factor was taken into consideration when the movie was made in terms of the level of personal life ""disclosure"" they felt was appropriate. Also, making the movie suitable for such a wide audience was a wise decision. It not only helped them rake in almost 1 billion $ but also helped get Queen's music out to every generation simultaneously. The R-rating on Rocketman is going to limit who will see it and how much money is made.4) Something I liked a lot more about Bohemian was the concert scenes. They felt more epic to me, like you were actually there in the audience or on stage with them. The concert scenes in Rocketman were really good but the fantasy sections came in too early for me. The scene where he sings Rocketman in the massive stadium was exhilarating and the kind of thing I wanted more of, and then he suddenly blasts up into the sky like a rocket and it really killed that entire scene for me. It just made me want to laugh.MUSICAL ASPECT: As I said I'm not really a fan of musicals nor fantasy, and being a fan of Bohemian and it's traditional biopic storytelling, I really wish Rocketman wasn't a musical. I would've liked to have seen Elton's story presented in a typical biopic way.CRITIC REVIEWS: Something tells me that the critics had an attitude of ""anything will be better than Bohemian Rhapsody"", so they jumped right in to praise Rocketman, and decided to ignore any flaws it has.MARKETING: I'm not quite sure why they didn't advertise this as a full musical, but my guess is they wanted to be vague in the trailers (kind of like Bohemian's trailers) in order to create enough buzz so that they could then ride on the coattails of Bohemian's financial success and the audience hunger it created for future music biopics. Not everyone likes musicals, so I think they wanted to keep the genre somewhat ""under wraps"".OSCAR POTENTIAL: I think Taron is totally deserving of an Oscar nomination, and the movie should also get nominations for costume design, cinematography, and the sound categories. Whether that happens or not and whether there are wins or not is unpredictable at this point because we're only halfway through the year and there will be a bunch more movies coming out in the next 6 months that could kick it out as a contender. Also, because it's a summer movie and not an ""awards season"" movie, the hype surrounding it may fizzle out by December/January.One scene I really loved was when Taron sang Tiny Dancer. His high notes were breathtaking! And the performance where he's dressed up in the huge puffy dress and white makeup was hilarious. There were definitely some fun, humourous scenes throughout the movie that I enjoyed.Sadly though, I felt like Rocketman didn't inspire any interest in Elton John in me. The mixture of dark and light moments, and the bipolar feel to the movie didn't help me feel uplifted or like I'd just watched a true celebration of a great artist. But I felt that way after I watched Bohemian and immediately dove headfirst into a Queen/Freddie Mercury addiction.If you're an Elton John fan, a fan of musicals, or part of the LGBTQ community, chances are you will love this movie.Although it's not my style, I can appreciate the creativity that went into telling this story, but I do think it belonged more on Broadway.I'm expecting tons of thumbs down on my review, but that's fine. I read hundreds of reviews that tore Bohemian to shreds, and while I didn't agree with them, we are all entitled to our own opinions. People need to learn to understand and accept this fact. Not everyone has to like or gravitate toward the same kinds of movies. Lastly, NEITHER movie is conclusively ""better"" than the other. Yes, they are both music biopics, but they are in vastly different genres (drama vs. musical fantasy) & use different styles of storytelling. It all comes down to personal preference and what speaks to/resonates with each individual person.",Rocketman,2019-05-31,7.3,141979,2019
tt2066051,1,"I am a huge Elton John fan starting from way back when I was a kid in the '70's, and although I knew not to expect a straight biopic from what I had already heard about the film, I certainly didn't expect this! From the first song straight through the rest of the film, all I was thinking is that what we were watching was the Broadway musical Elton has probably always wanted to do, and probably should have done instead of a film. Ironically, now there's talk of turning this into a musical, so why not have gone that route instead?I cannot even single out what was the worst thing about ""Rocketman"", but certainly the most irritating was the time frame of events/songs. My concern is that people of a younger generation who don't know much about Elton and see this film will think that certain things that occurred are fact, like that one of the songs he performed at the historic Troubadour show that helped catapult him to superstardom was ""Crocodile Rock"", when in reality, it hadn't even been written yet. Another concern was an example from a fan review I read on another website where a woman(who didn't seem like she was real familiar with Elton's life)said that after seeing ""Rocketman""(which she loved), she ""felt sorry"" for him. I really don't think that Elton John would want pity from his fans, but because there is so much emphasis on the unhappy events in his life, one who is not familiar with the man and his body of work would think he hardly had ANY good times in his life during that crazy superstar time, and he DID have a significant amount of fun, he has admitted in interviews over the last couple of decades.If this film was going to be a musical, it should have had at least a fair balance of good and bad times, and not so much a woe-is-me film. But even with a fair balance, the whole thing would have still probably been a hot mess with the way it was made. A straight biopic would have been SO much better. Somebody needs to make a REALLY good and detailed documentary(and it doesn't even have to be a film in theatres; it can be a multi-part series on a network like HBO or Showtime)on Elton John. If you really want to see something that more successfully captures the fascinating complexity that is Elton, I recommend watching ""Tantrums and Tiaras"" from 1997, the documentary that was directed by David Furnish(then-boyfriend, now husband). That will be far more interesting than ""Rocketman"" was, so save your money and skip ""Rocketman"", and I say this as somebody who's loved Elton John and his music for decades. Because I am a longtime fan, I really, really wanted to like, no, LOVE the film, but unfortunately, I just couldn't.",Rocketman,2019-05-31,7.3,141979,2019
tt2066051,4,"The movie isn't flamboyant enough to be a musical or deep enough to be a drama. It's a somewhat brightened up Wikipedia article about Elton John. Elton's parents were one dimensional cruel beings with zero reasoning or background. They hated the boy just because they did. And he became a broken adult because his parents hated him. Wow, that's a revelation original and artistic enough to make a 2 hour long movie about. That's a 2019-normal-zero-art-Netflix-style-shallow depiction of Elton John's life.",Rocketman,2019-05-31,7.3,141979,2019
tt2066051,4,"This highly-touted film about Elton John that blends the biopic and musical genres together has one big selling point: Taron Egerton's go-for-broke performance as the deeply troubled musical genius. Regrettably, the film as a whole is self-indulgent and cliche-ridden to the hilt and goes down as a misfire.Problematic right out of the gate, the film has to overcome a befuddling start which takes place from the tawdry vantage point of a psychiatric support group and frames the film's narrative from that trivializing angle from there on out. Perhaps a film of better nuance could have pulled this off but here we have camp, mawkishness and exploitation all rolled into one. The end result is a film whose tone is dumbfounding, annoying and at times embarrassing to endure. The musical numbers in this film are mostly perplexing and very rarely effective in conveying this life story.I am not one to criticize a biopic because I realize it's a genre that is beholden to the life it is portraying. While I don't question the film's accuracy in portraying how awful Elton John's personal demons were, a film with more discipline almost definitely could have done better. A campy film, one that keeps poking you in the eye with how bad it is, will not tell anyone's story all that well, let alone a legend like Elton John.Bearing in mind that Egerton's performance has to be seen to be believed, I nevertheless decline to recommend this.",Rocketman,2019-05-31,7.3,141979,2019

Also, I can't recall a single song lasting more than a minute or so, at best. You more-less get snippets of a lot Elton's songs, with the occasional symbolism added to some of them. What's unfortunate, in my opinion, is that some of his hits aren't at all played like the real songs themselvesIn regards to the acting, it was decent. There are some emotional scenes which were filmed quite effective, but, nothing that'll leave you sobbing.

Meanwhile, he's the center of the world's attention and making millions. There is not one ounce of joy in this movie.

tt2066051,7,"Rocketman decides to focus on Elton John's character evolution more than anything else, chronicling his life from when he was a wee-little boy to his glory days as the colorfully decorated, piano-playing, musically blustering star. One detail I must address that really hoisted the exploration of John's life was, in reality, the ""R"" rating.You get to see a respectful and psychological turn in his persona, you get to witness the heartbreaking ""addictions"" that he constantly forces himself into, you get to view the uncut collision of him dealing with his sexuality, and you even get to feel that loss of love that Elton had felt when he persistently questioned his relationship with peers. All of these affairs are dispensed without and blockades or any desires of censorship and I must commend the filmmakers for going about this risky decision.And sure, Rocketman is arguably quite the corn-fest at times, but the movie is able to take these cheesy elements of the typical rockstar biopic and format it into a creative fashion that characterizes more charismatic and less repetitive exhibitions. Which brings me to my next point...I am so pleased that Rocketman turned out to be a nearly full-on musical? I mean, it had to find some way to be different from Bohemian Rhapsody, right? Whenever a musical note comes on it's not just there for Elton John fan-a-holics. The songs always pertain to the presented events transpiring on screen. The methods they use to present the songs as well, offer some more than compulsive and devouring visuals. I also appreciated how they redid all the songs to fit the scenes in a more appropriate manner. It makes the film seem less like a compilation of Elton's original greatest-hits and more like a rendition of what each song means to the story.Now, Taron Egerton's performance in this is...wow, wow, wow, wow, WOW. He is just bleeding with range and chaotic pizazz in this encapsulation of a contrasted human individual. If someone is worthy of an Oscar nomination this year, it's this guy.Rocketman doesn't entirely rely on nostalgia like most of its kind does-that implying that sometimes it does, however-and most of its misfit adventures proved about in the story seem earned rather than glossed over at a maximum pace of negligence. Definitely check this one out, especially if you're an Elton John fan!",Rocketman,2019-05-31,7.3,141979,2019
tt2066051,10,"Ok this is the second time that i need to write something, im feeling responsible to tell the world that this movie is a must watch ! I watched it yesterday and the hole 2 hours were pure emotions and fun, after the movie i flet sad that it was over ; i could have sat in the cinema for 1-2 more hours. The storyline, emotions were overwelming and all actors did a great job here especially Taron Egerton. I will definetly watch it a second time in the cinema and immediatally order the blu ray,
these kind of films need to be supported !!!",Rocketman,2019-05-31,7.3,141979,2019
tt2066051,2,"I'm not sure if I saw the same movie as everyone praising it. I thought it was okay, but definitely not an 8 or 9 out of 10.
There are many problems with this film. The main issue, which I didn't realize until someone pointed it out in their review, is that the magic of listen to Elton John singing his songs is missing in this one. If you compare it to a recent, similar film by the same director (half directed by him), Bohemian Rhapsody, we get to hear Freddie's voice. Malik lip syncs to it, but that's why we fell in love with the artist. Taron does a good job singing, and performing, but he's NOT Elton John, vocally.
Second issue is that it's tonally all over the place. It wants to be a musical, or it wants to be a drama, it can't be both. Usually musicals are more upbeat. But I think the placing of a music scene is critical, and it just felt very repetitive in this movie. In fact, I took a bathroom break during one of the middle music scenes because I didn't feel compelled to stick around. I felt the drama scenes were worth more to sit through. The uneven tone just kept kicking me out of the movie.
The makeup for Bryce Howard was horrible when she was playing the older version of the mother. It looked like all they did was make her face lighter, it was pretty lazy. And why was the step father/boyfriend not considered a supportive person in Elton's life. I get that the mother and father were not as warm, but the step father, in addition to his grandmother, seemed to be a pretty good father figure.
Ultimately, this film fails to make Elton a sympathetic character. At least with Freddie Mercury, we did feel emotion for him and his plight. With Elton, it just felt more like 'woe is me' x 20, i.e. over and over again. Then the movie ends, and you're like 'okay, what was the point of this movie?' There is no point, no message. We just watch Elton's life set to a Mamma Mia-esque framework, with mediocre results.
If you have to choose to watch Bohemian Rhapsody or Rocketman, choose the former.",Rocketman,2019-05-31,7.3,141979,2019
tt2066051,5,"So I just saw an advanced screening of Rocketman and I have very mixed options about the film.To get the positives out of the way, I thought that Taron Egerton did a Fantastic job as Elton John, nailing both the personality and appearance. Jamie Bell also gave a solid performance as John's lyricist Bernie Taupin. All of the other performances were decent as well. The dialog wasn't bad or cringeworthy, with the exception of executive Dick James. Nothing was done POORLY necessarily, but I will say if Egerton was not in this film, I probably would have rated Rocketman a 4/10 or even a 3/10.
Let me get into all of my issues with this film.Firstly I need to mention that Rocketman is a musical, where moments of his life or feelings are related to John's many songs. I only feel the need to mention this because I feel the marketing was very misleading, convincing people that Rocketman was going to be a more conventional biopic. Now, the musical moments are done badly, but for a feature film that is about a REAL person and story, it doesn't fit well. What the writers and director were trying to go for would have made a better broadway show, instead of a theatrical release. There are also WAY too many of these musical-style moments, particularly in the final third. And to clarify, by ""musical"" I'm referring to a film like Moulin Rouge.I also felt like Rocketman glossed over a HUGE amount of events In John's life such how he recorded his first few albums, how he wrote songs with Bernie, etc. They could of included a scene of Elton helping John Lennon overcome stage freight or any other interesting stories during Elton's golden era, but Rocketman flashes forward to the start of his career to when he starts to descend into drugs. The most important part of his career is pushed to the side. Another example of this involves John's wife. We don't know who she is, how she knows him, or even her name. The actress is literally given around 6 lines. So when her three minutes of screen time are up, and you find out her and John have divorced, you don't care because you learned nothing about her.Also, going back to the musical aspect, some inaccuracies end up being raised. Like how Elton wrote Saturday's Alright for Fighting at 12 (which he didn't). I also question the idea of everyone he knew, save Taupin and his grandma, were so harsh and mean.Overall, Rocketman isn't an awful film by any means, and with Egerton's performance and the Your Song scene, I can still recommend this to extreme John fans. Otherwise, wait to rent.",Rocketman,2019-05-31,7.3,141979,2019
tt4520988,10,"Having seen both the first Frozen and Frozen 2 as an adult, my perspective might be different from others, but I have to say I actually like the second one better. The music is more interesting, the message is less simple and cheesy, and the effects are stunning. Granted, the story is a little complicated, but only enough to make it interesting. And let me say it again, the music is definitely better! Into the Unknown, Lost in the Woods, Show Yourself, and even the lullaby are moving, humorous, or epic pieces, and even the songs not mentioned by name here are at the very least good as well. Expectations were high for this movie after the first and I think some people expected something a little lighter and more fun, but this sequel certainly still has moments of humor and is a truly beautiful story.",Frozen II,2019-11-22,6.9,140311,2019
tt4520988,10,"I have to admit that I enjoyed this story even more than the first. Most sequels follow the same cliches of finding lovers, starting families, etc. this one continues right where F1 left off and builds on a current objective of ""finding yourself."" New information is added from what we learned in the first, such as what actually happened to their parents' ship, and it's both believable and interesting, which can't be said about most sequels. Over all I thought this one was great. As a side note, those few seconds from when Elsa rides out of the Dark Sea towards the shore of Ahtohallan is one of the most powerful I've seen in a Disney cartoon.",Frozen II,2019-11-22,6.9,140311,2019
tt4520988,6,"Frozen II felt unsatisfying. There was lots of build up to a very short climax that felt way too easy and simple. I kept expecting another adventure which never came. The film feels short and unfinished. That said, the animation is absolutely gorgeous and I did find the film quite funny. If you go into this with low expectations I think you'll enjoy yourself.",Frozen II,2019-11-22,6.9,140311,2019
tt4520988,3,"Your kids will love it, there's no doubt about that. There is serious talent behind the song writers and performers and animation team. The plotline itself is very well done, the issue was it's execution. For a film almost two hours long, everything was rushed. The film can only be described as an outline on paper that was made into film without the flesh between. Frozen 2 hardly gave the audience time to process one scene before we were thrown into another. Character motivations and emotions were traded for comedy relief in the form of Olaf, the sentient equivalent of ""exposition"".This film fails to narrate how a character got to a certain point, why this and that transpired, and the motivations behind each party, however overly narrates the message of the film quite literally through Olaf exposition as mentioned above.After being such a strong character in the first installment, Anna fell short and her emotions were conflicting (and not in the good way). Kristoff's only purpose in the film was to find a way to ask Anna a very serious question, Olaf had no other purpose or journey and while Elsa's journey was the saving grace, the film portrayed itself as if it had cut out 30 minutes of important back story and character decision making. This film lacked the emotion of the first, a sense of thrill, dread, traded in for series of beautiful visuals and fluid animation.The score was good but not memorable. The animation was absolutely stunning. From a child's perspective, the film would be given a 10/10, but from a film review standpoint, Frozen 2 failed to deliver.",Frozen II,2019-11-22,6.9,140311,2019
tt4520988,6,"Before I say anything, let me tell you that some girls were crying around my seats, so I think movie hits its demograhy.I liked the visuals of the movie, it looks amazing, better than first one. There's lot more going on happening in the movie and it's just 1hour 50 mins long, so a lot of arcs are very rushed and convenient. There are scenea where one character tells the other that this is what they have to do, to get something, with no explanation or reasons. There's lot of, I mean lots of, exposition. Characters tell the stories, tell something they just know or feel and flashbacks or hallucinations kind-of stuff.But this is a movie aimed to kids, and it's okay if the story wasn't technically sound. But for adults, this movie might be too silly at times.About the songs, this time expectations were high, and I didn't like a single song from movie. There were times when I felt they just ripped off their own song from previous movie, let it go. Like last time, no song connected emotiolly with the character, but they're well performed.Kudos to animation team, voice actors, art-designers.
Not so much for writers and screen play writers.",Frozen II,2019-11-22,6.9,140311,2019
tt4520988,3,"Wooden dialogue was otherwise we'll delivered. An excessive number of outright bad songs (with only one exception) were none the less well sung.Character arcs and motivations were rudimentary, though at least they were not out-of-character. Yet the overall narrative barely held together as a coherent story, from its entirely literal call to adventure then through one contrived conflict and convenient solution after another, ending a series of underwhelming climaxes.Poor writing was the problem, the screenwriting and the songwriting. There were decent ideas throughout the film that consistently failed in their implementation. It made for a film trying but failing to punch well above it's weight, more like a direct-to-video Aladdin sequel with higher production values then the unexpected breakout success of Frozen.",Frozen II,2019-11-22,6.9,140311,2019

It's about loving each other and respecting what we have. It also teaches us to not let fear take over and create darkness. It teaches us to not judge! My god I could go on for ages!

tt4520988,9,"(This has a post-credit scene in case you're wondering)The songs are great. Especially Kristoff's song, an 80's jam as Jonathan Groff would say it. Even the animation looks like an 80's music video which I find funny. Olaf's comedic skits are even funnier. For Into the Unknown, not as catchy as Let it Go but time will tell. The animation, the best. Elsa got even beautifuller. If you saw the water animation you would see *much* more of that. The story is bigger, questions are answered, but there are some points that look silly. The plot is predictable but personally I enjoyed it.The only thing I'm having a hard time agreeing with is the ending.",Frozen II,2019-11-22,6.9,140311,2019
tt4520988,2,"One incoherent nonsense mess that felt like the story was being made up as it went along. The end credits with about 6-8 different writers perhaps explained the reason for that.Nothing like the first movie based on Hans Christian Anderson's Snow Queen. No charm and characters such as Olaf were simply irritating and I couldn't care if any of them would have lived or died except for Kristoff. When the movie was trying to produce drama and characters were crying I felt nothing.Kristoff's song ""Lost in the woods"" and sequence were pretty good, the rest of the movie consisted of completely irritating songs that lacked rhyming where necessary. A character will start singing and I was thinking ""oh no, not another song"". How long is this going on for?Gets a 2 from me, literally one point above minimum for Kristoff's song.Totally doesn't deserve the success it's had.

There is no threat, no villain, no obstacle...Elsa wanders off to a 'fortress of solitude' type place where she dies? or freezes? Anna sings about her grief, the song itself was great but I couldn't feel anything for her because Elsa's outcome was very ambiguous? Anna is set out to do something that could set Elsa free but....there are no consequences which was mentioned about a hundred times...""the water will destroy Arendelle..."" and all of a sudden Elsa comes out of nowhere and stops the flood.

tt4520988,7,"It's not hard to imagine how big this movie will be. I, as well as many others, am a huge fan of the first film and the short films that followed it. Frozen II has a different feel to it. While the first film was brimming with quirky moments, the follow up feels a little more mature in its plot and themes. This story heavily centers around the importance of change, even if that means letting go. Throughout the film, I found myself dazzled with the quality and beauty of the visuals that the animation team laid out. The story, for me, felt a little flat, however. I think the writing team missed the mark when trying to achieve the same quirkiness from the original. With the more dramatic path the writers chose to take, also came more epic musical numbers and effects. Sure there were still plenty of humorous moments, but I personally felt myself longing for more. I also find irony in the fact that this film centers around change and the overall feel of the film felt like a major shift from the first. I do think this film will still appeal to many others and I, myself, am still very excited to watch it a second time. Overall, I'd say this film found success in what it was trying to achieve and the message it was trying to send to its viewers, but couldn't quite live up to the whimsicality of the original. While not as good as the first, it's still a film you will want to take your family to and is a great addition to the Frozen franchise. 7/10",Frozen II,2019-11-22,6.9,140311,2019

But outside of this it's narrative is completely unfocused and none of the character moments are given the time they deserve on screen.

As everyone states, the only great thing about Frozen 2 is the superb animation,, but the story is dry.The songs are not memorable or catchy as the original.

The animation was flawless, the songs were abundant and wonderful (nothing quite as earwormy as Let It Go, though) and the laughter was non-stop.The character growth was also a treat. I didn't expect that, especially from a character like Olaf.All the negative reviews I see complain about it either being too dark or all over the place. It was neither. Sure, it had some darkness to it, but so does life, and like most moments in life, their is a shining bright light waiting on the other side, even if it's not the ending I would have expected.And to those saying it was all over the place? It wasn't, if you bothered to pay attention. But most of you are adults who write off every animated feature as children's fare and don't really care to pay attention. And that is because you've lost the child inside. You've forgotten how to feel joy and excitement and embrace it like you did as a child. You confuse your contentedness with your children's happiness with actual joy and live vicariously through them than embracing what's inside of you and living your own happiness yourself.

I get that they tried to give her powers a backstory but it just feels so forced and off, the worldbuilding they tried to do doesn't feel natural.
It felt like there were so many things missing, there was no evil that had to be defeated, no big character arc, nothing. Everything happened so fast and then it was just over.

The first was truly great for the music, scores, themes and vocals, this one; ""pity that didn't have a song like the first one"" was a comment from someone leaving the theater.

Were given our mission, and our characters.The four main obstacles occur to about 20 minutes of the run time total, with the rest of the film being (for a lack of better description) 'nothingy.' there was a big missed opportunity for else and Anna to explore the kingdom, but instead Disney decided to make it all the same. Granted, there was a cool shipwreck and some nice features such as the bridge, but the world was rather disappointingly plain.The final battle (although looking stunning) was nothing special. The build up and the soundtrack truly big it up too much. Not to mention the songs, so forgettable and do many of them. Whilst ""let it go"" was never my thing, it was catchy, and easy to sing along to. With the sequels ""into the unknown"" being (questionably) the main song, it's surprisingly drab.And finally theres the cliche ending of them all living happily ever after, but with the proposal added in as another unnecessary event to make the audience scream ""awh!""There were some good things however, being the overall pleasant nature-esque aesthetic. and the animation does look brilliant as well.

It was an extravagant celebration of the studios' own legacy and its musical traditions from across the eras but no one expected it to be the phenomenon that it became & it left a cultural impact that was undeniably unforeseen. Six years later, Frozen II surfaces with hopes of repeating the same feat yet nearly everything about it is inferior to the original.A visually breathtaking yet narratively hollow sequel that lacks the freshness of the first film and is a step down in storytelling quality too, Frozen II does have a few things working in its favour but it is not the follow-up chapter that's able to validate its existence. The film is a passable effort at best that manages to mask its shortcomings with spellbinding animation but the effect doesn't last for long this time around.Unlike its predecessor, a lot of its musical numbers end up affecting the narrative flow and aren't that catchy either. Anna & Elsa's arc remains captivating, plus the sisterhood bond is strong as ever but the other characters, both new & returning, are a letdown. Even the humour goes downhill, diving into silliness at times, and the only aspect that keeps its afloat is the photorealistic animation that provides the film its mesmerising beauty.Devoid of the enchanting flavour & invigorating aura that made Frozen a classic for the new generation, Frozen II does steer into darker territory as it should and even had an interesting premise about mending the cracks left by forefathers in addition to Elsa's search for her origins but it fails to balance it all in a fascinating fashion and doesn't dig enough to strike a heartfelt chord.

tt8079248,7,"After being subjected to a number of films documenting the lives of musicians - most notably ""Bohemian Rhapsody"", ""Rocketman"" and ""Rolling Thunder Revue: A Bob Dylan Story"" - it is truly a pleasure to be presented with a film that sheds light on the work and life of an artist while not adhering to the strict (though desirable) biographical approach. That is exactly what makes the piece so marvellous; I came out of the cinema with a greater appreciation of The Beatles, and their music, through a fictional story that did not feature the four men we are familiar with at all. Quite often the film achieved my admiration for the band without me consciously noticing.On another level, the film made a satire of the modern music industry. It revealed how the apparent ""solo"" artists are far from their titles; with huge teams of people pushing them in a preferred, and more commercial, creative direction, taking the musicians' creative power. This was done in a humorous light (as most themes are presented in the film). The romantic aspect of the film is evident from the beginning and is a dominant aspect of the story, possibly shifting the focus of the piece a little too much. However, it still helps provides a satisfying ending.The film pays a great amount of respect in a fresh way while cleverly interweaving other conflicts.",Yesterday,2019-06-28,6.8,117659,2019

The music helped carry a lot of it through (unsurprisingly). What they missed was it wasn't necessarily the songs themselves but the era in which they came out and the meaning of the time. Movie just presented it as almost instant stardom if today's world heard the songs which lets be honest today's generation wouldn't understand half of it. It didn't really present a clear vision of ""why"" which I was looking for towards the end to help tie things up. Lights go off on the planet he takes a bump on the head then the Beatles never existed? Alternate universe? Dream? Thought there would've been something more there. There were a few things that bothered me with the story that the movie made it seem like they were pieces to the puzzle but then never did anything with them. First is through the film he also finds out other things don't exist as well such as coke, cigarettes, the band oasis, and Harry Potter. It seemed like these things were going to connect into the story and why the Beatles music isn't present but they just left it there and he kind of says ""oh well"" and nothing comes of it. The second was he finds out there are two others that also know the Beatles music and again seems like this should be a big part of the story to tie things together as to a bit of ""why"" but they just have a conversation about it she gives him an address and then that's it. His conversation with what I think is supposed to be John Lennon didn't make sense either. Does that mean the other 4 exist? Did they never meet to make music? Just all added up to a great idea that worked early in the film but didn't follow through properly. All my opinion of course",Yesterday,2019-06-28,6.8,117659,2019
tt8079248,10,Refreshingly original and entertaining. The story flows and the characters are relatable and well developed. Not what I expected from the trailer but I liked it better than what I expected. So nice to see someone take a chance on an original story.,Yesterday,2019-06-28,6.8,117659,2019
tt8079248,10,"There are some movies that when released simply don't need a big marketing campaign. Just a few words of description of the plot are enough to put it on your ""must see"" list: ""A struggling musician has a cycling accident during a freak global blackout and wakes to a world where noone other than him remembers the Beatles or any of their songs."" When I heard this I said to myself ""yes, Yes, YES""! But would it live up to my expectations?This is a Richard Curtis penned film, and that's immediately enough to put a tranche of movie-goers off. All his movies have an accent on the uplifting, the positive and/or the whimsical, and I can understand why that winds some people up. If ""Richard-Curtissy"" was an adjective, and I think it should be, many of these films can be so classified.Here, although again very Richard-Curtissy, I think he gets the mixture JUST RIGHT.... ""Yesterday"", for me, was a complete joy from beginning to end.I imagine Curtis getting this story from a rowdy dinner party round his gaff. He asks his guests, over the third bottle of dessert wine, to play a wild and fantastical ""what if"" game (in pursuit of the ""very good"" spare brownie of course). At this particular event, I guess it was co-story-author Jack Barth (in his movie-writing debut) that made the successful attempt to ""hog the brownie"". For the premise of ""Yesterday"" is quite brilliant, whilst at the same time being utterly bonkers too!That being said, the story is not completely original. I thought there were many similarities to the Ricky Gervais vehicle of 2009, ""The Invention of Lying"", where Gervais alone finds he suddenly has the ability to tell lies, and finds ill-gotten fortune and fame as a result. Much like that earlier film, much of the joy here is in the recognition of the gift given and the dawning realisation of what this might actually mean to him. As such, I found the first half of the film a lot more enjoyable than the second.The conundrum facing Jack is to remeber all of the Beatles songs and their lyrics (without having Google as a reference), and much fun is had with him stumbling into situations that suddenly remind him of a new track or a particular snatch of lyric.There is of course an obvious explanation for the whacky storyline, since the hero has received a potentially serious head injury. But would the film go there? (No spoilers here).Himesh Patel is from TV's ""Eastenders"" but here makes his movie debut. He is perfectly cast as Jack Malik: in the film, he's a name about to rise from utter obscurity as a Lowestoft retail assistant to global superstardom. Patel is charming and believable as he squirms with his conscience. A surprising and touching beach scene in the final reel of the film is exquisitely acted.The ever-watchable and utterly gorgeous Lily James here goes brunette: she was actually unrecognisable to me from both the trailer and the poster! Here she makes a very believable high-school teacher with a side-line in management and roadie-ing.I found Ed Sheeran's cameo in ""Bridget Jones Baby"" to be excruciating! But here, in what is quite an extensive part, he is much, much better. I think he's been getting lessons.One of the slight disappointments with the film is that it is a Danny Boyle film that doesn't FEEL like a Danny Boyle film. Aside from some inventive on-screen titles, I didn't detect much of the stylisation that I would expect from one of his films. Yes, there are occasional flashes of genius - for example, the scenes where Malik is desperately trying to remember the lyrics of Eleanor Rigby, and those of him watching, big screen, his own social-media led rise to super stardom. But otherwise, the visuals and storyline are pretty linear in nature.Although there are cloyingly gooey bits of this film, the element that weaves it all together - such that ""all is forgiven"" in my book - is the magical music and lyrics of McCartney, Lennon and Harrison.Was there a better year to be born that 1961? (Well, possibly the mid- to late- 50's so you were old enough to remember more of it). But although only a child aged between two and nine during their album releases, I felt the benefit of three older siblings who WERE able to fully embrace Beatlemania. And the film delights with its modern day recreations of the classic tracks and, as already mentioned, Himesh Patel belts them out wonderfully (especially, I thought, with ""Help!"").I can't not give this one 10 stars. I simply loved it, and can't wait for its general release (in the UK, on June 28th 2019) so I can go and love it all over again. Is it technically a 10-star film? Possibly not, but sometimes you just have to go with the way a film makes you feel, not just as you walk, whistling, out of the cinema but for the whole of the next 48 hours and (I suspect) longer. In summary, he loves it. ""Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeeeeeaaaaaah"".(This is an edited version. The full graphical review is available on ""One Mann's Movies"" on t'internet or Facebook.

tt8079248,7,"There were three main reasons really in seeing 'Yesterday'. The alternative world scenario sounded truly fascinating, one of the most fascinating concepts in recent years to me and a refreshing change from the remakes and sequels constantly made today. Like to love a lot of Danny Boyle's previous films and find him a talented director. The Beatles are not all time favourites but do appreciate him highly, understand their influence in music and like a lot of their songs a lot.While it could have done more with its concept, 'Yesterday' turned out to still be entertaining and charming that put me and my sister in an uplifting mood leaving the cinema. Had not had an easy day, or week even, up to seeing the film, so 'Yesterday' was a much needed and appreciated antidote. As far as films released in 2019 go, it is neither one of the best or worst in a hit and miss year and somewhere around solid middle if having to rank.'Yesterday' is a slick looking film, not exemplary but never cheap. Lily James looks great and the camera clearly loves her. The music of course is fantastic, it is The Beatles after all, with some of their greatest hits exuberantly performed, making one want to sing along regardless of whether they know all the words or not. ""Hey Jude"" is one of the most memorable examples. The script balances amusing comedy and never over-sentimental drama without making it too cartoonish or mawkish (well mostly).Story-wise, 'Yesterday' captures the feel-good spirit affectionately and the portrayal of the music industry was fun and didn't get over the top. The John Lennon bit is a highlight. Boyle has done better and more inspired direction, but still directs at a crisp pace and balances things quite well. The performances are good, a truly charming James coming off best. Himesh Patel has come on a long way since 'EastEnders' while Kate McKinnon is riotous in the manager role.On the other viewpoint, the concept was so fascinating and while it is always engaging the story is predictable and a bit too ordinary. Especially the final third, which is pretty much exactly as one would expect.Ed Sheeran's ""extended cameo"" for my tastes was rather puzzling and didn't seem to gel with everything else.All that aside, it was an enjoyable film on the whole and worth seeing. 7/10",Yesterday,2019-06-28,6.8,117659,2019

The whole idea is great, haven't seen those yet in mainstream cinema. The plot is pretty much straight-forward, with likeable characters, great music (of course) and when the movie was over, it left me with good feeling and a smile on my face still singing Hey Jude.All actors are really good, but Lily James is so adorable in this movie! She shines in her character and steals every scene she is in. Liked her the most (obviously).Take your girlfriend/boyfriend/friends/family to see this rom-com fantasy music comedy in cinema on a big screen, and even if you won't like the movie, you will sing Beatles songs after and feel good about it (guaranteed)!",Yesterday,2019-06-28,6.8,117659,2019

The plot just became unbelievable, it also turned corny and over-sentimental. Of course I accept the whole movie was built on supernatural premise but what follows must hang together and keep the audience rooting for our hero.What was good:1, I loved the music, I think this made the movie.2, Jack Malik, played by Himesh Patel, did a fine job, he has mastered irony and deadpan, we were all wanted this antihero to have his dream.What was challenging;1, the plot was either so corny or so contrived, some plot twists were just unnecessary and added nothing.2, Elle, played by Lily James, lost our sympathy, she was presented as needy and pathetic and just as the culmination of him achieving ""their"" dream, she tries to make him choose between his dream and her.3, The conclusion was unsatisfactory, he wanted to be a musician and was fabulous at it, he ended up a teacher, big mistake.Overall, the was an overly contrived feel good movie, I enjoyed whilst I was watching it, but feel cheated and unsatisfied at the end.",Yesterday,2019-06-28,6.8,117659,2019

tt8079248,9,"Hey, there is a moment in every one's life when you need a break, and you need to remember that life can be simple, can be romantic, can be wistful, can be about remembering what matters and why.
This movie is not about fixing the world or fixing the audience, it is about bringing a smile to your face while providing a special pleasure that we did not know we were missing out on: the one that allow us to revel in the sound, poetry and consciousness of one of the most iconic band the music scene has known.
I enjoyed the movie with my kid, who used to sing the Beatles when she was a toddler and that turned into a teenager not particularly interested in the music her parent enjoyed, who had as much a blast as I did during the movie.
The acting rand true, the emotion were genuine and the music was a blast, there is absolutely no reason to miss out on this cool concept and movie.",Yesterday,2019-06-28,6.8,117659,2019
tt8079248,4,"Yesterday is pure cinematic fluff with a lightning-bolt of an idea. In moments, those substance-less joys earn their cuteness. But, as with writer Richard Curtis's other films (About Time), there's a unique ethical question underscoring the surface: what rights does an artist have over a creation they didn't create? Should we be honest about ""reality"" when that reality isn't reality? Confused? Don't worry; that complexity is all but completely brushed under the rug here, opting instead for cheap explanations and corny romance.
Because of unimportant and uninteresting reasons, an aspiring musician (Patel) discovers he is the only person in the world who remembers The Beatles. Patel is great in the lead; with impeccable timing and effortless charm, he manages to steal all these classic songs without losing our sympathy. He's supported by a handful of genuinely funny and sweet moments: jokes at the expense of Oasis and Ed Sheeran, the reveals of other erased cultural touchstones (Coca-Cola, Harry Potter, etc), even a surprisingly moving reveal of others who remember the past. Unfortunately, the story doesn't do much to help. Lazy storytelling shortcuts are taken at every turn, making a fantastical concept even more difficult to believe.
Curtis is usually quite adept with this type of rom-dramedy, but he's not at the helm here. Boyle is, and he's known for his hyper-stylized direction, which proves problematic. Where he spends time working on montages of ridiculous metaphorical storytelling devices, he should be fleshing out character motivations and ethical conundrums. Yesterday makes me glad we live in a reality with The Beatles, so we can ignore this movie and stay home to listen to Abbey Road.",Yesterday,2019-06-28,6.8,117659,2019

Jack's struggle with the dishonesty was obvious throughout the film. The music was superb. Ed Sheeran's portrayal of himself was super cute.
I was a little worried the writer would take it over the top and Ed would decide Jack was better than he and decide to stop making music. I am very glad they didn't go there with the story.
Jack coming clean near the end and the way he did it, was a good ending for me.
Also the fact that The Beatles were not the only thing/person to disappear during the blackout was a fun touch.

tt8079248,9,After Bohemian Rhapsody and Rocketman. Yesterday is the next movie based on the classic song sang by a classic musicians. But unlike Bohemian Rhapsody and Rocketman which are biography movies. Yesterday is a fantasy comedy movie which is a different take from the previous two. Did the movie deliver or did the movie disappoint. After seeing the first trailer back in February I was very interested in the its unique concept of the movie.The plot for the movie centers around Jack Malek who is a struggling musician until he had a bus crash while power was turned off about 12 seconds he then finds out that he is the only person who knows the songs of the Beatles.The movie delivered on its premised in a lot of levels. The performances by Himesh Patel and Lily James was excellent they had great chemistry and you can feel their friendship grew throughout the movie. I thought Ed Sheeran wasn't that bad in the movie and he was a lot better than I expecting considering that most real life musicians acting was mostly bad. The movie featured lots of classic Beatles which was great even though Let It Be was on briefly I was expecting a full version of the record in the movie. But that didn't ruin the whole movie. The ending of movie was very moving and emotional don't going to say anything about the ending but it was lovely ending.Overall the movie was excellent it was original but unlike a lot of original movies that has a great premise but didn't deliver this movie does deliver with great performances and a wonderful ending this movie is to enjoy by everyone who loves the the Beatles or just want to have a great fun time at the cinema.

tt8079248,6,"To cut a long story short, with a film directed by Danny Boyle and based on a legendary band such as The Beatles, I was expecting significantly better, although the movie is definitely not bad. The love story between Jack Malik and Ellie Appleton is excellently interpreted by Himesh Patel and the gorgeous Lily James, while Kate McKinnon vervely interprets a sickening impresario. But the movie is globally disappointing with a certain flatness and a script suffering from a blatant lack of originality: the « Twilight Zone » effect has been seen again and again so many times. In fact, by being slightly in bad faith, the film Yesterday (2019) can almost be reduced to the Beatles songs. I am fully aware of the exaggeration, but allow me to moan and groan: I'm slightly disappointed with such a banal rom com about The Beatles, a stuff of legend across all periods of time.",Yesterday,2019-06-28,6.8,117659,2019
tt8079248,8,"Of course the film is packaged within the most basic, cliched even, romcom format. Childhood sweethearts never expressed love for each other, then something happens, their relationship gets strained, until love wins and is declared publicly.This isn't a whodunnit, you can guess the ending from the trailer. You will have seen countless films like this and you come to expect everything that happens to happen. Just as you expect a chorus after a verse in a Beatles song. Or any other pop song.But within that outer layer there is a very interesting subject that the film explores: what if we lost something that brings us all together? What if we didn't have a shared cultural experience to which we all give the same meaning?When the blackout happens, the Beatles are not the only thing that disappears from public memory: Jack googles ""coke"" and the search engine - which is what gives Meaning these days - displays a picture of Pablo Escobar. So when Jack asks a waitress for coke, it is not a ubiquitous beverage that the woman thinks of.And so Jack finds himself with the opportunity to gain fame and riches by appropriating what had been a pillar of our post-war popular culture globally: the Beatles catalogue. Because the true premise of the film is this: everyone likes the Beatles. And Beatles songs therefore can be used by us all to communicate with each other.Soon though Jack finds that the music has lost its universal meaning for the people who now appreciate ""his"" music. He is confronted with the ruthless pragmatism of the music industry, all the while being isolated by his alien cultural baggage and climb to fame.So when he reunites with the only two other people unaffected by the blackout, he finds that meaning again, and the plot finally twists.This isn't a film about the Beatles' music, it isn't a documentary about their legacy - it's a film about a world suddenly losing shared experience, about losing a ""consensus"" that brought us together.That's why I thought the ending, the other part of the ending, the one I'm not going to spoil, was so uplifting and progressive.

tt8079248,5,"Yesterday tells the story of Jack, an amateur musician who is trying to break into the industry with the help of his best friend Ellie, but when he gets hit by a truck riding his bike home one night, he wakes up in an alternate universe where several things have turned out to have never existed, but most importantly the Beatles and their songs. Jack decides to take advantage of this, and uses the Beatles' music to launch his career, becoming the most famous pop star in the world.That premise sounds great, and I was looking forward to a surreal comedy, but to be honest, it doesn't quite live up to it, instead getting distracted by what the actual main plot turned out to be: a cliche romantic comedy with the childhood friend that is secretly in love with the protagonist, only for him to figure it out for himself later.The best moments of this film are to do with the central premise of the alternate universe, where Jack would reference something, only for the people around him to say ""what's that?"" I mean, it's the same joke in different words basically every time, but hey, the way they execute it is pretty good. There are also some decent satirical moments with Jack interacting with the music industry, personified by Jack's manager, and an extended cameo by Ed Sheeran, who falls victim to some self-deprecating jokes, but overall seems to be the secondary 'star' of the show besides the Beatles' music.Speaking of the Beatles, you'd be surprised by how little they actually contribute to the plot. For a film that is named after one of their more famous songs, you'd think that their music and impact to society would be more than just a plot device for the main character to achieve his success. There's no real commentary as to why the Beatles music is so great, you're just told, over and over again, that they're the greatest band ever, and that a world without them ever existing would suck. Sure, that is something I would agree with, but the film doesn't really add much of their own perspective to that side of the story, it just takes that idea as fact.The romance is decent, but cliche and overall unremarkable. Screenwriter Richard Curtist definitely knows how to write romances, having written several well regarded romcoms, like Love Actually and About Time, but I would say that Yesterday isn't quite up to that standard. Same goes for Danny Boyle and the other films he directed compared to this. The direction isn't bad, but it's bland and doesn't really add much to the story. There are some weird shots, like some weird dutch angles near the beginning of the story that seem out of place, but nothing else unusual or amazing about the camerawork either.I guess if you like romcoms and Beatles music, this movie will definitely be watchable, but for me, as a person who doesn't actively seek out that genre, this film didn't stand out to me in either direction, and overall I'm disappointed that they didn't take full advantage of the great premise.",Yesterday,2019-06-28,6.8,117659,2019

tt7798634,7,"Written by Guy Busick and R. Christopher Murphy, and directed by Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett, Ready or Not is a horror-comedy and social satire that comically exaggerates the anxieties attendant with marrying into a wealthy family and mocks the insular nature of such families, so obsessed with their wealth that they've become disconnected from the real world. In the tradition of Richard Connell's 1924 short story, ""The Most Dangerous Game"", the film is about elites hunting common folk, but it tells its story with tongue firmly in cheek. And whilst it can be a tad episodic at times, and the manner in which it presents some of its violence is somewhat problematic, this is a very enjoyable and funny film that's well worth checking out.It is the wedding day of Grace (an exceptional Samara Weaving) and Alex Le Domas (Mark O'Brien), whose family earned their fortune making board games, and are now decadently wealthy. Several years previously, Alex turned his back on the family, and it's only since he met Grace (a foster child eager to have a family to call her own) that he has started to rebuild bridges. His mother Becky (Andie MacDowell) and father Tony (a barely sane Henry Czerny) are thrilled to have him back, and credit Grace with his return. His aunt Helene (a hilariously acerbic Nicky Guadagni), however, makes no bones about the fact that she hates Grace. Elsewhere there's Alex's brother Daniel (Adam Brody), an alcoholic locked in a loveless marriage to Charity (Elyse Levesque), and their cocaine-addicted sister Emilie (a wonderfully hapless Melanie Scrofano) and her husband Fitch (a scene-stealing Kristian Bruun). Shortly after the ceremony, Alex explains a strange family tradition to Grace - whenever someone new marries into the clan, they must participate in a game, chosen at random by a mechanised box using a deck of cards (Charity gor checkers). At an austere ceremony, Grace is asked to operate the box and she receives the hide and seek card, with Tony explaining that the only way for her to win is to stay hidden until dawn. And so, Grace hides in the mansion, unaware that the family (sans Alex) are arming themselves with crossbows, axes, hunting rifles, and assorted antique weaponry.The film's various psychoanalytical/satirical subtexts are fairly obvious - a lampooning of blue blood families clueless as to how the real world works, a savage deconstruction of the institution of marriage, and a gynocentric celebration of a woman fighting back against old-world patriarchy. In relation to these last two themes, nowhere are they more apparent than in Grace's wedding dress, that most classic symbol of marriage, which becomes dirtier and more damaged as the film progresses, with costume designer Avery Plewes using the dress to show the stages of Grace's symbolic deconstruction of the institution of marriage (to survive the night, she must make the dress more conducive to running and hiding, which involves a lot of ripping and tearing).Concerning the film's engagement with wealth, essentially it suggests that, yes, as we all know, the rich are very different from you and I, but could it be that not only are they different, maybe they're actually evil? Of course, it's not suggesting this with anything even approaching realism, and much of the film's humour comes from the Le Domas family itself; they're wealthy, evil, violent, and powerful, but so too are they hilariously incompetent. For example, it's been so long since anyone has got the hide and seek card that everyone is a little fuzzy on the rules, and they spend a good chunk of the film arguing with one another about the hunt - Fitch and Charity want to use modern weapons, but Tony maintains they have to use antique weaponry, nor are they allowed to use the castle's security cameras to track Grace.This all goes back to a century-old deal made between the family's original patriarch Victor and a mysterious traveller named Mr Le Bail, who promised Victor that the family would become hugely wealthy, but only if they maintained the tradition of having new family members play a game on their wedding night, laying out the rules for what was to happen if they got the hide and seek card. Tony argues that the rules can be no different from those originally established by Le Bail, but, really, his argument never amounts to much more than ""tradition...reasons"". The film gets a lot of laughs out of showing characters trying to get to grips with their weapon - from Fitch taking time out from the hunt to look up ""how to use a crossbow"" videos on YouTube to Emilie accidentally dispatching several maids due to her inability to handle her weapon.Another theme, although one not developed to the extent of the above, is religion. Le Bail, for example, is believed by the family to be a demonic figure, and his name, obviously enough, is an anagram of Belial, the demon from the Tanakh who would later form the basis for the Christian and Jewish depictions of Satan. On the other hand, Grace's name most likely references the idea of Divine grace. Elsewhere, the film depicts a pit of slaughtered goats, alluding to ritual animal sacrifice, a pre-Christian practice. Goats are also important in Christianity, especially in the practice of scapegoating, whereby a goat takes upon it the sins of the community and is cast into the desert, symbolically removing the taint of those sins (as per Leviticus 16:8-10). Along the same lines, Grace injures her hand on a nail, in a veiled reference to the Stigmata. However, whether or not we're supposed to interpret her as a Christ figure is hard to say as, although these references are interesting in isolation, they never really coalesce into anything concrete.Looking at some other problems, the film is, generally speaking, very slight; it's short and it's silly, and it's not going to change your life or lead you down the road of esoteric revolution. The violence is also (somewhat) problematic. The film maintains the stance that the rich are insane and the violence they mete out is contemptible. However, some of the biggest laughs are reserved for Emilie's accidental killing of the maids. And I have to admit, I found the way she haplessly dispatches two of them exceptionally funny. Also funny is that after one of the kills, the family are trying to have a conversation, which is continually interrupted by the gurgling of a mortally wounded maid; until Helene takes an axe to her head. And again, I have to admit, I laughed a lot at that scene, even though I recognised that the film was essentially asking the audience to see this violence as funny but some of the violence elsewhere as not so much. In this sense, it kind of wants to have its cake and eat it, picking and choosing when the audience should laugh; it takes Grace's stakes seriously but also encourages us to laugh at some (and only some) of the violence elsewhere, which is problematically inconsistent.Nevertheless, as I said, these scenes did make me laugh, so make of that what you will. Although Ready or Not is slight, its satirical ire is focused, even if the tendency towards irreverence doesn't always chime with the tone of the socio-political agenda. Allegorically skewering inherited wealth, marriage, tradition, even religion, the film suggest that with their atavistic rules and sense of entitlement, the Le Domas family embody the concept that old-money can lead to insularity from modernity. Offering us a match, the film suggests that perhaps the only way to deal with such irrelevancies and their sense of self-importance is to burn them to the ground. And it has a blast showing us why.",Ready or Not,2019-08-21,6.8,113026,2019

Very well paced film with a fun enough plot that you can't help but enjoy.It stays grounded in reality with a character that you can relate to and genuinely want to see survive as she continually makes smart choices.

tt7798634,4,"Ready or Not tries to be a mixture of a comedy and a horror movie and fails at both. The movie is never atmospheric, intense or scary enough to be a great horror movie. The film is never clever, surprising or vibrant enough to be an entertaining comedy movie. Even by poor b-movie standards, the story of this film is completely ridiculous in a way that it's almost insulting.If you were wondering why this film still deserves four points, the movie isn't entirely bad. The settings look great and especially the mansion where the sinister hide and seek game takes place is really gorgeous, including hidden hallways and elegant gardens. The movie features a few intense action scenes that make you root for the desperate lead character. The film has a fast pace and doesn't overstay its welcome with plodding storytelling. Lead actress Samara Weaving does her best with a poor script and has enough charisma to be the only great actress in this film.Ready or Not should be ignored since it's neither a gripping horror film nor a clever comedy. It's a shallow action film with a few gore elements. Movies like You're Next are similar in style but executed much better. The overtly positive reviews for Ready or Not show that expectations for horror movies have significantly decreased in an era of prequels, remakes, sequels and overall rehashed ideas. Refer to European or Asian cinema to find some creative horror movies these days.",Ready or Not,2019-08-21,6.8,113026,2019
tt7798634,7,"Ready or Not is a fresh take on the slasher genre. It crafts a creative arch on the basic storyline concept that is rarely done in movies with similar genre. It is not the typical house invasion or vacation goes wrong.Ready or Not serves a plate of dark comedy that escalates as the run time goes along. What makes this so great is the general get to spot each laugh easily, not just its specific target audience.For a slasher film, Ready or Not deserves an applaud for its remarkable acting performances by the cast. Everyone shows their distinct characters from behaviour to costume that they are so entertaining to watch similar to that feeling when you get dozens of characters to choose from in a game.The lead character, the one who you will be rooting for is created in such a way that she is not dumb like in most movies. However, she is not smart either but the circumstances make her character safe from the trap of being a daft person. In other words, the movie does not unravel her intelligence nor her ludicrous manner.Also, the lead character has little to no character development. The fundamental question of her historical context and background is extremely lacking that we as the audience fail to connect with her as humanely as possible.The biggest complaint has got to be the rushing third act (final 30 minutes). The first two acts peel its layer off one by one steadily but the third act however loses its balance and goes downhill. They tried to do something completely different but it fails to satisfy the audience because we want something more pleasurable than what they have given us.Verdict: Ready or Not is a phenomenal gem that breaks the stigma free of 'slasher genre is dead'. However, it is not considered a masterpiece although seems very close due to its disastrous third act nature that falls short compared to the other two acts.",Ready or Not,2019-08-21,6.8,113026,2019

tt7798634,3,"While the concept of The Most Dangerous Game involving a woman against her in-laws is somewhat original, the execution of this film is bad.Problems:
1. This is probably the most undeveloped main character I have ever seen. You learn almost nothing about her history or desires, which makes it really hard to care about her more than the fact she's being chased by murderers. Most of the characterization and time is spent with the family members, who are the villains, and almost all of them are pathetic.2. The profanity in this film is over the top. The characters probably swear twice as much as a Tarantino film, and with a lot less creativity or impact. It would be funnier to hear the ""blue-blood"" family start swearing once things start getting so bad for them, but all of them are swearing left and right from the beginning of the film so there's no escalation that makes the profanity interesting.3. The film teases out a class struggle at the very beginning, with the protagonist concerned about marrying into this upper crust family, but along with the swearing from #2 these family members really don't act very high class at all, the main character Grace has a posh accent that doesn't make her come off as lower class, so this plot/theme goes nowhere at all.4. It looks like the filmmakers were trying to make this more realistic at times (but not consistently so), so the main protagonist has no special combat skills, ingenuity, or athletic ability. As a result, too many of her ""successes"" are pure luck or someone doing something stupid. As a result, this film pits the Unremarkable vs. the Unintelligent. This isn't that exciting.5. There are really very few interesting set pieces, probably due to lack of imagination or funds. The action appears in short, boring bursts, and there's no visual wow factor. You get the feeling they didn't have much in the way of stunt coordinators.6. A related problem is that you never get a good perspective of the mansion or grounds, and with characters wandering in and out of the plot at random, you never get a really good perspective of how difficult it would be to ""seek"" Grace. The film just meanders from room to room, and the tension of the hunt just dissipates as a result. I'm guessing they just didn't have the funds to acquire a good interior location for the set.",Ready or Not,2019-08-21,6.8,113026,2019

tt7798634,2,"I was intrigued by this one because of all the positive reviews, even though the trailer didn't quite sell it for me. It looked like a cross between The Purge and Eyes Wide Shut.
Anyway, the movie starts of alright, the set up for what is about to come first with a flashback of the childhood of the boys, who then we see in present day is getting married to a blonde outsider played by Samara Weaving.
I actually liked her initially. She seemed like someone we could root for and hope would kick some serious butt. Ultimately, I found her unlikable, just like all the other characters in the film. What was it about her I didn't like? Well, she just doesn't sell the role very well. Is she bad ass or is she just lucky, everything seems to work out too conveniently for her, considering she has several people hunting for her. She doesn't appear to have any fighting skills. But the worst part: Her scream. Ugh, every time she did that yodeling scream, I couldn't stop thinking about Adam Sandler in the waterboy. Or tarzan lol. I've never heard an annoying scream like that before lol.
The story's pacing and tone is just all over the place. Much of the killing is accidental, nothing happens due to skill. There were too many predictable moments, like that 'goat pit' or whatever they called it that scene was too obvious where it was going. And clearly the family didn't care about piling bodies out in the open?!
And the swearing was terrible. I'm no prude, and I look a good f word in the right place, but this movie was mainly filled with unfunny moments where the characters keep saying wtf over and over. The dialogue really needed improving.
The ending was kind of funny, but ultimately, unsatisfying. It really didn't make any sense either.
Overall, this movie was just okay, I'd recommend watching it on Netflix. I watched for a discount price so I can't complain. I give it 2 marks for the reasonably good CGI gore in a few places, but that's about it.",Ready or Not,2019-08-21,6.8,113026,2019

You either kind of liked them or you didn't. They weren't great films so why would you expect this film to be one?

tt8404614,10,"I'm not a Catholic, and this movie is very, very Catholic. But beyond that, it's one of the deepest cinematic examinations of faith I've ever seen. Sir Anthony Hopkins and Jonathan Pryce, playing Pope Benedict XVI and Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio (who later becomes Pope Francis) respectively, both deliver brilliant, finely crafted lines with stellar performances. (It's somewhat ironic that two Welsh actors are playing a German and an Argentenian, but most of the film is spoken in English, so it works out in some strange way.) I really didn't follow the most recent transition between Popes, so I had not expected to be so deeply involved with this movie, but I am very glad to have watched it. Highly recommended for its insightful look into the human condition and the underpinnings of faith with its sometimes wavering texture, even for the most religious of us.

All the things I like in a movie and yet, I loved it.It's well directed, planned, written and interpreted.Thanks for making it, Netflix!",The Two Popes,2019-12-20,7.6,109126,2019
tt8404614,10,"Much has been made of the brilliance of the two title performers, and deservedly so. Both Hopkins and Pryce are absolutely convincing as German and Argentinean pontiffs who converse in English (conveniently for viewers) as their common language. Each actor is so fresh and alive within the personality of his ""character"" that I was easily persuaded they may be truer to the souls of these men than the living originals.
Not enough credit has been paid to Anthony McCarten, the writer of this complex, layered conversation. It is the kind of dialogue great men wish they had spoken. What courage and skill it takes to undertake such a verbal tour de force.
(Imagine if world leaders couldn't hire speech writers. Could Shakespeare's kings and queens really speak as well as he wrote for them?)
McCarten has written the scripts for three Oscar-winning actors; isn't it time he was recognized?
And Fernando Meirelles is the masterful director who brought all the elements together. This is a renaissance man, adept in many fields, from architecture to cinema--and organic farming as well. He has been nominated for one directing Oscar (for ""City of God""), and here he shows his ability to maintain both visual interest and intellectual fascination through two hours of what amounts to an intense, extended talk.
That the movie never felt ""talky"" is a tribute to all four great artists.",The Two Popes,2019-12-20,7.6,109126,2019

tt8404614,7,"This is quite a clever piece of work. Both performances demonstrate a complex, sometimes conflicted, humanity in a touching and thought-provoking way. Hopkins, as the scholarly Benedict XVI coming to realise that he no longer feels capable - for various reasons - to remain Pontiff and Pryce as Cardinal Bergoglio with whom he has little in common, and who has come to Rome to seek his permission to retire. The story focuses more on the trials and tribulations of Bergoglio as he rises to prominence in the Jesuit order and navigates the political turmoil of Argentina in the 70s and 80s where he develops a much less ""conservative"" approach to the issues facing the Catholic Church than his Pope. By the conclusion, however, both men appear reconciled to the honesty and integrity of the other. The extent to which the detail is true is anyone's guess - but by using humour, sport and even ABBA, this proves to be an intimate observational film that is certainly one of Netflix' better commissions.",The Two Popes,2019-12-20,7.6,109126,2019

I never served time in prison but have certainly received rich rewards from dramas about prison.I am not British but I enjoy English actors, who have far more formal training in classical drama than Americans. And these two actors are among the very best ever. The drama may be accurate or not, it does not matter. It is clear that one pope had a different style than the other. Both were sincere on their beliefs and both were men of faith.I am an atheist but loved the film. That is because I am a skeptical atheist and as I age I think about what a person of faith might feel at my age that I do it feel.

tt8404614,10,2 enormous actors and 1 giant director. One beautifully crafted and played masterpiece. And forget about being christian or any religious beliefs. This is purely art demonstrating the relationship between us. People. Humans. Very different but at the end all the same.A must see.,The Two Popes,2019-12-20,7.6,109126,2019
tt8404614,8,"Being inaugurated as a new pope in the last century must have been a source of enormous pride. But there must also have been a nagging thought... at some point you are going to be paraded, stiff as a board, around your work courtyard before being taken back inside to your place of work and buried there!All that changed in 2013 when Pope Benedict XVI resigned, the first pope to voluntarily do so since Pope Celestine V in 1294. (Pope Gregory XII also resigned in 1415, but he was effectively forced to).This movie tells the story of that curious situation, when Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio (played by Jonathan Pryce) ended up as Pope Francis while Benedict (Anthony Hopkins) was still alive. The official reason for the pope's resignation appears to have been his advanced age. But the film paints a rather different picture.The movie starts back in 2005 as we enter the papal conclave. Benedict (Cardinal Ratzinger, as was) is the highly-political German cardinal who desperately wants the papacy; Bergoglio is the highly respected Argentinian cardinal who doesn't seek the office but might have it thrust upon him. (Clearly, when the white smoke clears, history has dictated the outcome).But flash forward to 2013 and Bergoglio will get another bite of the cherry. Is he worthy of the role? Through flashbacks we return to Perón's unsettling rule over Argentina and the events that made the man.The two stars are simply outstanding together, and it's no surprise at all that both have been nominated in the Oscar acting categories. They are almost joint leads. But - perhaps to give the film its best awards-season shot - Pryce is down for Best Actor and Hopkins is down for Best Supporting Actor.Anthony Hopkins in particular for me shone with the brilliant quietness and subtle facial movements that are the mark of a truly confident actor. Less is more.I was enjoying this movie enormously up until we flashed back to the Argentinian sub-plot. Set in the time of Perón's ""Dirty War"" when a huge number of people - estimates range from 9,000 to 30,000 - simply went ""missing"". There's nothing wrong with this sequence of the film. For example, a reunion of Bergoglio with a persecuted priest, Father Jalics (Lisandro Fiks) - is brilliantly and movingly done. It's just that for me it seemed so disjointed. It was jarring to switch from this Evita-era drama to the gentle drama of the papal plot.If the movie had been 30 minutes shorter and focused on the mental struggles of Benedict I would have preferred it. Curiously - we don't really get to fully understand his divergence from the faith. Bergoglio gets no end of back-story. But Ratzinger's is probably just as interesting, but not explored.This is still a really fine movie and will appeal to older folks who like a story rich with character acting and not heavy on the action or special effects. The director is Fernando Meirelles (who interestingly directed the Rio Olympics opening ceremony!) and it's written by Anthony McCarten, the man behind the screenplays for ""The Theory of Everything"", ""Darkest Hour"" and ""Bohemian Rhapsody"".You may still be able to find this in selected cinemas (e.g. Curzon) but it is also streaming on Netflix, which is where I had to watch it.(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on the web or Facebook.

tt8404614,10,"If you are expecting a dull film because of the title, you will be happily mistaken. Nothing about this film is dull, and this is not coming from a Catholic. The two main characters could not have been more well cast and one cannot miss the stark polarity of roles between Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter and Pope Benedict, at least I could not. I also adore Pryce in every movie I have ever seen him in, this one as well, and the two actors together are superlative. The music is fantastic and the visuals are gorgeous, all accompanied by a riveting script. Whether you are any type of believer or not, there is value in seeing this film.",The Two Popes,2019-12-20,7.6,109126,2019
tt8404614,9,"If you read ghost-written books, you will discover that story is often offered ""as told to"" the real writer. With this movie, we are offered the biography of Pope Francis as told to Benedict XVI, the first pope to resign in more than half a millennium.More than that, it's the tale of their rapprochement: although Benedict was a conservative, and Francis as radical as you could be, they were -- and, as both men are still alive as I write this, are -- motivated by sincere faith, always listening for the voice of a G*d that more secular-minded people like me don't believe in.The real joy of this movie, though, is not the beautiful settings, nor the elaborate clothes and jewels that cardinals and popes wear -- when he is putting on the robes to assume the See of Rome, Francis refuses the jewels, the red shoes and similar appurtenances, remarking ""the carnival is ended"". It is the performances, Jonathan Pryce as Francis, Anthony Hopkins as Benedict, talking, arguing, being human with each other. These performances look simple. That is the magic of great actors, directors, writers, cinematographers, to produce something that looks simple and very human by means so arcane that not even the professionals can be sure of getting it right.",The Two Popes,2019-12-20,7.6,109126,2019

The witty and even sometimes scary realistic nature of the writing in this film gave me chills.

Makes the SECRETARY OF STATE who possesses the same qualities fall for him. It isn't about oh look at the nerdy guy get the pretty girl. NO?!!! This is simply a man and woman who find one another and fill in the gaps in their own lives. I thought it executed the political climate in our country beautifully and fairly. One of the most ground breaking scenes I have ever seen in a hollywood film. All in all if you're super liberal or super conservative, you'll hate it and won't be able to take it for the true love story that it is.

tt2139881,8,"Long Shot (4 out of 5 stars).Long Shot is actually a funny romantic comedy film that delivers with Charlize Theron and Seth Rogen's performance. Involving a little story in the political world with a Secretary of Defense wanting to run for President. And try to help and change the world.The plot follows journalists Fred (Seth Rogen) and his childhood crush Charlotte (Charlize Theron) who used to babysit him when he was a teen. She is now a Secretary of Defense and trying to run for President. She hires Fred to help her with her speech and trying to help be an influencing leader. While they both start falling for each other. While her team is against them having a relationship which he might be a bad reputation for her running as President.I am not really a big political person. The plot does involve Charlotte trying to help save the planet and thinking more green. She is trying to save the world for the better. Fred is a democrat and coming from a case of being undercover in a White Supremacist club. Which he jumps out of a window in a three story building cause they found his cover. Fred has been closed minded about the other people's perspective in the political parties.Seth Rogen and Charlize Theron are great with their roles. It was fun seeing these two on screen. Theron playing Charlotte, and getting high on a drug which she gets an emergency call to help negotiate with another political leader in a different country was a lot of fun.Director Jonathan Levine and his witty script was a lot of fun.

tt2139881,8,"My first R-rated movie starred Seth Rogen.Growing up in a fairly conservative and religious focused family, my first R-rated film (in the theater, mind you-I was blessed to already have had my fair share of home release viewings in the basements of friend's houses or in secret, thanks to my Blockbuster employment connection) was the Rogen and Heigl raunch-fest-with-a-heart Knocked Up.Knocked Up, if you recall, stars Rogen, an overweight, expired frat boy who has no interest in growing up, and Katherine Heigl, a model-esque, large-and-in-charge-with-no-time-for-a-social-life television producer, as the parents-to-be of a surprise pregnancy after an incredibly drunken one night stand. Critics raved about Rogen and Hiegel's performances, solidifying Rogen as bonafied movie star and launching Heigl's career.Fast forward ten years and some change later, and once again I found myself in a theater, anticipating yet another Rogan vehicle where the plot seemed somewhat recycled: a beautiful blonde (this time played by the always excellent and committed Charlize Theron) and an average Joe (a slightly more mature, Rogen, complete with his trademarked genuineness) somehow get involved romantically, in a tale mixed with a generous helping of penis jokes, heavy drug use, and the exuberant use of the F-word sprinkled around like confetti.I went in thinking it would be mediocre.A few hours (and lots of laughter) later, I'm happy to report this one pleasantly surprised me.Theron plays Charlotte Field, the current Secretary of State making the strategic moves necessary to announce her bid for the 2020 presidency. Rogen portrays vulgar-yet-honest alternative journalist Fred Flarsky. Field faces an up hill battle in the presidential race for literally being a woman (something audiences know a thing or two about since the 2016 election), and her team wants her to come off relatable and likeable. Fred, recently laid off due to a large media corporation buy out of his independent online newspaper, thanks to the devious workings of an old, privileged white male tycoon (the never-recognizable but never mistakable Andy Serkis), needs a job.When a chance meeting at an elite party has the pair cross paths, it only takes a few a minutes for the two to connect and make the realization that they went to high school together. Fred had a crush on Charlotte, who had big, beautiful ideas about making the school a better place when she ran for student body president. Charlotte remembers him as the smart, sweet kid who lived next door.Days later, after scrolling through his past articles, Charlotte goes against the cautioned judgment of her campaign team and hires Fred as her speech writer, and immediately the two, along with the rest of her team, embark on a round-the-world tour, touting Charlotte's ""Save the Bees, Trees, and Seas"" initiative, a flowery sounding vision that's to be the anchor of her campaign (and something adult Charlotte still believes in).From there on, it's easy to see where this story is headed. Charlotte and Fred grow closer, as he interviews her to get a better handle on her voice for the speeches he crafts. They butt heads, they disagree. He calls her out for compromising on her beliefs when a country negotiates changes to the initiative, she tells him he is out of line and to remember that at the end of the day, she is his boss and that sometimes you have to play the game to win the game.To anyone questioning if Theron and Rogen have chemistry, the answer is a solid yes. It looks like it shouldn't work, both due to their differing acting resumes and their physical attributes. But Theron and Rogen take their unique blend of class and crass, humor and heart, and it honest to God works.Sparks fly, feelings happen, and before you know it, this film treads into familiar territory, a gender-reversed Pretty Woman that happens to involve politics (complete with the beloved pop standards one would expect from the aforementioned film and typical rom com fare).But then the movie goes deeper than that, and while it appears to be a lighthearted popcorn flick with an edge, there's a lot of subtle (and not so subtle) messages bubbling below and on the surface. The unfair treatment of women by the media, the shallow game politics has become, the necessity of standing by one's beliefs while recognizing when we need to set differences aside to actually accomplish things, and an encouragement to men to support the women in their lives, even if she is more successful than them.
Especially when she is more successful than her them.It was these thoughts that had me pondered as I drove home, ""could movies like this be the answer? Could unassuming, middle grade romantic comedies be the catalyst for starting conversations in the real world?"" Too often, certain audiences are turned off by movies that come off as more lecture than entertainment. But what if a movie, disguised as a comedy, provides honest political commentary in an easy to digest manner that helps audiences reach across the aisle with their perspectives? Could a movie featuring a solid boner joke, a viral video with an unfortunate masturbation mishap, and a highly respected political figure high on molly negotiating a hostage situation like a straight up boss be the one that finally stops people in their tracks, makes them scratch their heads, and state ""I never thought about it that way before?""Honestly, probably not.But given the choice between yet another film with a blatant message that feels like a lecture that won't be heard by the audience necessary, or Long Shot, which tackles political differences in an entertaining and delightful manner, I'd go with the latter.By a long shot.",Long Shot,2019-05-03,6.8,96515,2019
tt2139881,8,"Politics is a game of appearances and navigating mass appeal, of course, and it's doubly hard for a woman, no matter how beautiful, how solid her policy positions; early focus groups score Charlotte in the 90th percentile, but ""if you were a man, you'd be in the '190s,"" Lisa Kudrow's press manager admits. The key to ensuring her electability? To bring her 'humor' factor up a few points, to make her seem more relatable to the American public. After all, a woman can't just be smart and capable - she has to be one of the guys, as well. On top of that, she has to be fodder for romantic gossip, whether with Fred or the gormless Justin Trudeau-like James Steward (Alexander Skarsgård), with his toothy grin and inoffensive good looks.Much the same can be said of Theron, an actress who can seemingly do no wrong, offering crackerjack chemistry with Rogen while standing out in her own standalone comic scenes. Rogen's the funnyman of the equation, but even his wisecracks can't hold a candle to a late-film scene where Charlotte has to suddenly negotiate the return of a captured American soldier while rolling Molly hard. Whether she's kicking ass in full-on action pictures, winning Oscars in prestige dramas, or cracking wise with the best of them in comedies like this, Theron is a movie star of indefatigable range. Hell, I'd vote for her.All of this only scratches the surface of Long Shot's unconventional charms and doesn't even mention the beautiful, scene-stealing presence of O'Shea Jackson Jr. (an actor I've loved since Ingrid Goes West) as Fred's laidback, successful best friend. But that's the appeal of something as warm, easygoing, and unexpectedly political as Long Shot: if you want to see it for the Seth Rogen jokes, have at it. But fully engage with it, and you'll find a lovely romantic comedy about two people struggling to make a relationship work when the fate of the free world (and public opinion) is at stake.",Long Shot,2019-05-03,6.8,96515,2019

tt2139881,9,"I get why there are some 1 star reviews for this, it certainly leans left politically. Seth Rogen's character is a pretty far left journalist who gets swept up into the political games of a major democrat player, Secretary of State Charlotte Field. She is trying to get a major worldwide environment deal done and has her sights on the White House. The movie does make a point that Fred Flarsky (Seth Rogen) isn't able to see things from opposing points of view like reasonable Republican values. At face value I get why Republicans in this hostile political environment would hate this movie, but I don't think it's that simple. The message that we should work together is what both sides should all be getting behind. We will just divide further and nothing will ever get done if that happens. Just my 2 cents.
Politics aside, this film was the biggest surprise of the year at the theater. I loved it. Charlize Theron is amazing in it. Seth Rogen does his usual thing, which I usually enjoy. It has some great side characters in June Diane Raphael (from How Did This Get Made podcast), Bob Odenkirk, Andy Serkis, and O'Shea Jackson Jr. The movie was very funny and had a really engaging love story. If you've seen some of Charlize Theron's interviews about how men are too intimidated to ask her out in real life (she says it really sucks) then you can actually believe that her character could conceivably fall for the passionate journalist Fred Flarsky.I highly recommend this film. 9/10",Long Shot,2019-05-03,6.8,96515,2019

Going up against a powerful man in a even more powerful company, Gretchen seeks help from other female employees to come forward and speak up and make an end to this man.I really enjoyed this film, but felt I could've enjoyed it even more if I knew more about the story when it was happening. In saying that, it didn't make the film confusing or bad in any form.
It's a powerful story that needs to be shared for how woman can be treated in the workplace and hopefully spreads the message that inappropriate sexual behaviour is never acceptable and should be spoken up about.Nicole, Charlize and Margot were all so damn good in this film. Three incredible ladies. I would've liked to have seen a bit more on Margot's character, but I then learnt after that her character isn't part of the real life scandal.This is a great movie to start off the new year.",Bombshell,2019-12-20,6.8,93433,2019
tt6394270,8,"It takes courage to place this true story before the public at this time of the political climate during debates by presidential candidates and retorts from the sitting president who is famous for his association with Fox News. Charles Randolph (The Big Short, and The Life of David Gale) has written a penetrating screenplay about the 2016 explosion when Fox News persona Roger Ailes was finally exposed for sexual harassment by some courageous women. Director Jay Roach (Trumbo, Blown Away, Austin Powers: International Man Of Mystery, etc) makes this story come vividly to life, unafraid to insert film clips of Donald Trump's appearances as the case unfolds, as well as including the lesbian relationships that give the story a new grounding.The story of this Fox News scandal is true, so everyone knows the outline. As one distillation states, 'When Gretchen Carlson (Nicole Kidman) slaps Fox News founder Roger Ailes (John Lithgow) with a lawsuit alleging sexual harassment, not a soul could predict what would happen next. Her decision leads to Fox News correspondent Megyn Kelly (Charlize Theron) coming forward with her own story, as well as multiple other women, such as Kayla Pospisil (Margot Robbie), inciting a movement that reverberates around the world.'The cast is outstanding: Charlize Theron, Nicole Kidman, and Margot Robbie each excel, but the other women in the film - Allison Janney, Connie Britton, Liv Hewson, Kate McKinnon, and Brigette Lundy-Paine - also impress. John Lithgow is very appropriately repugnant as Roger Ailes, as is Malcolm McDowell as Rupert Murdoch, and the clips of Giuliani, Trump et al. The tension never lets up as this scandal is related in fine form. Not only is the film excellent (though some may prefer the Showtime series THE LOUDEST VOICE account of the scandal), but also it offers award winning quality performances that allow the actors to step into different territories.",Bombshell,2019-12-20,6.8,93433,2019

For me it was TV show of a year.

I think the women deserved better than to have their stories embellished.,Bombshell,2019-12-20,6.8,93433,2019
tt6394270,9,"This was a risky film to make. It's taking a sensitive topic and basing the story around true events that happened within the last 5 years, including stuff around Donald Trump. As well as this, the movie isn't strictly drama with a 'Vice' type vibe around it. However, at least in my opinion, they pulled it off. It balances the almost comic feel it has with serious moments and intentionally uncomfortable ones. It's a scathing look inside mega corporations and how sex is sold.There's very strong performances all round, from Charlize Theron as Megyn Kelly and Nicole Kidman as Gretchen Carlson to John Lithgow as Roger Ailes and Margot Robbie as the made up Kayla Pospisil (although the scenarios she's placed in are no doubt based on fact). Perhaps the single most uncomfortable scene in the film involves Kayla as Roger insists she lifts her dress to show him her legs, urging her to go higher and higher as television is a ""visual medium."" It's the type of scene that would be uncomfortable in and of itself but Robbie portrays Kayla's clear distress masterfully and the feeling is heightened once again when you consider that this sort of stuff has happened in real life to real people. The film also spotlights casual sexism and objectification as the women working for Fox are told to wear short dresses and aren't allowed to wear pants. Most of the 'compliments' they receive are about how sexy they are rather than their skills as a journalist.As well as a commentary on the sleaziness of higher ups in corporations, it also celebrates the courage shown by people like Carlson who speak up even when they know it could cost them everything. Theron displays her characters inner conflict brilliantly, working up to the stage where she's ready to speak out too. There's tension in the air and the camera-work adds to this with rapid cuts and dramatic zooms throughout.Bombshell is a great movie standing alone but a movie that also feels relevant in this #MeToo era. It reinforces that the most powerful figures aren't invincible and, though not easily, can be brought down too.",Bombshell,2019-12-20,6.8,93433,2019
tt6394270,5,"BOMBSHELL 5 out of 10
Consistently disengaging.Charles Randolph, co-writer of best adapted screenplay Oscar winner The Big Short (with Adam McKay, based on the book by Micheal Lewis), wrote Bombshell. He should not be allowed to write alone.The material he had to work with in bombshell had every opportunity to be engaging, however it was horribly executed with maybe 1 good scene of tension and drama.
There is a cautionary foremessage about the presence of dramatisation in the movie. There is no way the movie is less boring than the real events that occurred.No character was given any depth, with the only distinguishing feature being the A-list actor in the part. Randolph could not choose a focus for the story, not any of the characters or even the main issue was followed to any significant degree; instead, the movie diverts to unnecessary tangents about what our characters are up to in their personal lives in what I can only assume was an attempt to humanise the cardboard cutouts. I couldn't care for any of the characters.By an acting standpoint, I managed to spot 3 good actors, Charlize Theron, Margot Robbie and John Lithgow. Lithgow's performance was genuinely engaging as was most of Theron's.
The few Australian accents in the movie from the Murdoch family were laughable as they parkoured between British, American and have-heard-of-Australia levels of accuracy.Maybe in an earlier draft of the script Kate McKinnon served a purpose, Bill O'Reilly was more than a name or Margot Robbie wasn't reduced to an extended cameo, but these are only some of the useless elements that made this movie feel an hour longer than it was.Thematically, the story is hollow, with the only thing the movie says is 'sexual harassment bad', delivering a message beyond safe, that it barely registers as a message. Randolph was unable to even fully commit to any political view on such a significant event, with certain scenes trying to be apolitical and political, displaying anti-trump notions whilst emphasising the reliability and integrity of Fox News, with only a slight left lean, leaving the story forgettable. (The Trump sections were played as cute references?) However, seeing how it reflects my political ideology, it must be good 10/10.But wait. Isn't it hypocritical for such a big Hollywood movie to condemn sexual harassment whilst also practicing a far more toxic culture than a Fox News office? No because the movie is anti-sexual-harassment, so I think they learnt their lesson.There were very few scenes of significant CGI use, but boy were those 2 scenes very distracting. An actor on a roof looked like they were floating, with surrounding buildings and rooftop antennae looking less real than their wigs, and an actor was not well composited into archive footage.Consider me thoroughly disappointed.

tt6394270,4,"I had low expectations for 'Bombshell'. And they were met.Every once in a while a film comes along in order to take advantage of a real-life event. The films immediately following 9/11 for instance.And like those films, this one fails.And the reason it fails is precisely because it is 'real'; concerns actual people. In this case two former TV personalities from FOX News. Neither of whom (Charlie Theron as Megyn Kelly, Nicole Kidman as Grechyn Carlson) tugs at our heart. They are privileged women. And yes, they were taken advantage of by a sexist man in charge of a sexist company. Even so (1) we never see either of them harassed and (2) they are, despite it, living the good life. Their houses, their vacations, their children; they are people of the Top 1%'.Which leaves us Margot Robbie's character, fictional news producer who is charged with evoking sympathy and anger from the viewer. We want to know enough about her to feel the shame, the 'self-revulsion' she must feel following each instance of harassment. But while there is one scene depictingv thiz situation, and though her character says she is a 'millenial evangelical', there is not enough shown of her to have us believe in her past, or feel what she feels.Charlize Theron is great as Ms. Kelly. Nicole Kidman is 'lost at sea' as Ms,. Carlson; she is a non-character if ever there was one. I enjoyed Margot Robbie but wish there was more of her and her character's back story. John Lithgow was fine, I guess; his Roger Ailes was a weasel, but perhaps not quite enough of one.",Bombshell,2019-12-20,6.8,93433,2019

tt6394270,8,"This film is quite good, but I think you HAVE to like politics and know Fox News to enjoy it. The best part of this movie are the performances. The way the story is structured seems to lack some coherence, but it almost feels like chaos, which it makes it really feel like a newsroom. The story is based on real events, but the dialogue is made up, so keep that in mind. What I appreciated about the film is how it didn't seem to insult Republicans, rather the toxic culture of the news network. The audience is intended to sympathize with the women. The critique is mainly of Fox News, not conservatism. The tension built around Interactions with Roger Ailes is nauseating. Again, watch it if you know fox and like politics. Otherwise, you're probably not going to enjoy it.",Bombshell,2019-12-20,6.8,93433,2019
tt6394270,6,"While I wasn't all that familiar with this story that went on behind the scenes at Fox News, I was very intrigued to see a film tackling one of the very first stories of women taking a stand against a powerful man, abusing that power. While this was a great story overall, there are a lot of elements missing here that could've made it a fantastic film. This film feels more like a tool to showcase how corporations have been run in the past, but there wasn't enough depth to really dive in. Filled with great performances and a true story worth exploring, here's why I believe Bombshell is one big missed opportunity.This film follows a few main characters, but the centrepiece of this story is the fact that Roger Ailes would sexually harass women in order to give them higher positions at Fox News. He did this for years and many of these women kept silent in order to keep their jobs. If this film is accurate, Gretchen Carlson was the first one to speak up and many began to follow her lead. There is a lot of information and many insightful moments that kept my attention, but this film severely suffers from relying on those two things. More than anything, Bombshell wants to get messages out, but the pacing was slow and it felt like I was watching a newspaper article unfold on-screen.Charlize Theron as Megyn Kelly was a show-stopper, Margot Robbie as Kayla Pospisil won me over every single time she was on-screen, and Nicole Kidman committed to her role of Gretchen Carlson to the point that I believed every action she made. The problem is that the material they were working with didn't care about making a masterful piece of cinema. This movie would've worked so much better as a documentary in my opinion. Yes, these performances will absolutely be remembered, but the information I got from this movie is what I will remember it for, rather than the film itself.This film is being recognized the most for Margot Robbie and Charlie Theron's performances and the Make-Up and Hairstyling awards, which it absolutely should be, but I also feel another positive is the fact that it also has no shame. This film is presented in a way that makes news outlets look like a disaster to work for and I admired that aspect. I enjoyed watching this movie for the most part, but it just felt like it dragged on, which was surprising, seeing as it only clocks in at about 108 minutes.In the end, Bombshell is well-intentioned but ultimately comes across as an exposé. The performances are all fantastic and the story itself was intriguing enough to hold my attention the whole time, but there wasn't much else to latch onto. While this story deserved some kind of film, I don't believe an adapted narrative was the right decision. Overall, I would say this movie is worth watching, in terms of being informed, but it feels bland otherwise. I wouldn't say this movie deserves your attention, but the story does, however you choose to find out about it. As a whole, it's okay.",Bombshell,2019-12-20,6.8,93433,2019

It was a remarkable story of brave women that had nothing to do with each other taking a risk and coming together but they turned it into something as bland as reading a wiki page about it. No emotions and no true feels.Watch the loudest voice if you want to learn more. Far more powerful and better acted while showing how his genius allowed him to get away with his despicable acts rather than just making every male at Fox News look like a devil and Fox News women look stuck and/or helpless.",Bombshell,2019-12-20,6.8,93433,2019

tt6394270,7,"I was extremely interested in watching this film. Fox News is a circus at times but I really wanted to see a portrayal of the incidents surrounding sexual harassment and Roger Ailes. I also thought the three leads involved are really great castings and wanted to see how two of them portrayed Gretchen Carlson and Megyn Kelly. The film touches on important matters that has recently come to the light in droves, however the film doesn't always reach its potential although I did enjoy the film for the most part.
The film is based on the story of the accounts of women who worked at Fox News and the allegations that came out against Fox News CEO, Roger Ailes. A movement that is led by seasoned television host Gretchen Carlson, after her firing from the company. She is soon joined by other women including Megyn Kelly. The film has a really great cast including Nicole Kidman, Margot Robbie, Charlize Theron, and John Lithgow. Jay Roach returns after a brief hiatus in film making to bring this effort.
I have to commend the make up department firstly. Theron really looks like Megyn Kelly in this film that at times I feel like its hard to not see Kelly. Same with Kidman as Carlson. The acting delivers on all fronts. Margot Robbie who plays a fictional employee who typifies the type of victim Ailes prayed on, was also very good. I was very interested in the subject matter for this film as its timely and should make for a riveting story. A shocking story based on a wicked truth coming to light; this should be a very worthy film. Unfortunately, it doesn't quite reach that potential.I feel like the film could go deeper into making a statement although I was fine with what we got. At times it felt like the film was more interested in showing the real life correspondents being portrayed briefly, rather than going in depth into characterization. Not a bad film but feel like it wanted to be more and I also wanted more from it. Not sure its going to make awards buzz outside of Theron and Robbie's performances.6.5/10",Bombshell,2019-12-20,6.8,93433,2019

I think there should be more movies like this.It's amazing how much they made Theron look like M. K (you literally almost forget it's her, like in Monster).

tt7984766,5,"Overall I enjoyed watching this movie. I like period pieces like this and Netflix delivered again. The acting, cinematography, and battle scenes were fantastic. Unfortunately the story line is interesting but completely false with its character depictions and timelines. Not only did Henry V's brother Thomas not die prior to his father as shown at the beginning of the film, but he actually served as a commander in the English Army and died 8 years later well after the battle of Agincourt which is shown at the end of the film. Sir John and the French Dauphin also don't historically die in the battle of Agincourt as depicted in the film. Sir John actually loses the battle of Patay a few years later against Joan of Arc and becomes the scapegoat that is blamed for the defeat. The Dauphin is actually crowned the King of France after Joan of Arc wins a few important battles 14 years after the battle of Agincourt. There are other historical inaccuracies as well but I've made my point. Like I originally said, I enjoyed the movie and applaud certain aspects about it, but ultimately the director/ writers should have done a little more research first.",The King,2019-11-01,7.2,91682,2019
tt7984766,5,"Once I went to a medieval times restaurant with my father. The section we were seated in was the ""Green Knight"" section and the Green Knight turned out to be the villain of the play before us. My father got a bit excited by this. At one point the king declared that he was making peace with the Green Knight's country. My father then shouted ""No peace, war! War!"" I feel like almost everyone in this movie is doing the exact same thing for Hal.Now, I'm quite a fan of Shakespeare as well as something of an amateur historian. I have a small library of books dedicated to British history and the monarchy. So I was excited by the announcement of this film as it touched two passions of mine. Needless to say, it wasn't quite what I thought it would beIt's very clear that this production is only minimally based on the famous Shakespeare plays. They borrow the characters and follow the same plot to a degree, but it bears very little resemblance to the plays beyond that. This isn't about the matter of language, but more the feel and actual story of the plays.That's not always a bad thing. The character of Falstaff is not just a cowardly buffoon like in the plays, but an interesting man and capable warrior even. Still a drunk yes, but his character is richer and has more depth than in the plays.No my main problem is Hal. Though acted well, Hal just feels so very out of place in this story. Like I said about my father, Hal is the king desiring peace while my father is everyone in England desiring war. Hal feels like a 21st century man in a medieval drama. It just doesn't fit, especially not in history.The real Hal, or Henry V, was actually a man of his time: a brilliant warrior and quite the opposite of the pacifist he seems in this film. The fact of the times is that war was popular in medieval times, and war with France was very popular in England as they had quite the rivalry. There is a reason Henry V's son, Henry VI was deposed twice: peace, especially with France, was seen as weakness. Henry V would have been raised from the cradle to believe France was the enemy and England should defeat it. It just struck me as so completely out of step to have Hal be so against war. Perhaps they were afraid they would make him look like a warmonger, but that would have been easily enough to avoid. Rather they fail to grasp that this is a historical film, and the truth of the matter is war was the most effective means of diplomacy and brought about glory and popularity. There is a reason Richard the Lionheart has a better reputation than he probably deserves in England: war equaled strength and in that day a man wanted to be seen as strong.It's not a bad movie. The acting is good, the story isn't bad either, but it clearly wasn't meant for people like me. If I didn't understand the tine period as well as I do, know the plays so well, nor have studied the true history as I have, I probably could have given this a higher score. It's a good drama, but Hal just stands out as out of place and nothing like a true medieval king.",The King,2019-11-01,7.2,91682,2019

For reasons known only to Netflix, precisely the opposite is portrayed in this film.So Daddy disinherited Henry and made Thomas the heir, really?? (NOPE) So Thomas was green and got killed in battle before Henry IV died, really?? (Both sons were seasoned warriors, and Thomas died well after Agincourt.) So Falstaff (Sir John Oldcastle) heroically died at Agincourt, really?? (Henry executed him in 1417.) There's much more, but the point is made.So sick of historical figures being transformed into someone they weren't to suit whatever message the screenwriter is pushing.

What ever you do don't believe the low rating some others have given it because it is not accurate and you will need to question the motivations of those scoring this film so low when it is worthy of much more. Maybe a touch of jealously cause it is a Netflix film. The acting is superb with a great script, crisp cinematography and wonderful sound. The director transports us in the 15th century and we are captivated by the situation King Henry V finds himself in. Surrounded by corruption and men who are willing to kill each other for property and status.All the cast was brilliant and the two lead actors were exceptional.The only negative is that it is a touch long. I say that it was long but I can't see anything that could have been left out.

Prince Thomas was not killed by the Welsh shortly before Henry IV's death (he died fighting the French six years after the battle of Agincourt, eight years after the death of his father).

tt7984766,2,"This is a pretty good movie, but I'm only here to nitpick one little thing that bothers me.The writers for The King could learn something from what the writers of The Last Kingdom got right -- timeless language. The dialog in The Last Kingdom is entirely believable because they are saying things that sound like what people in the 9th c. might say. But when a character in The King says that reforms are easier in a time of ""regime change,"" that is very jarring. It's very contemporary, 21st c. terminology. Why not just write ""when there's a new king?"" Period drama would be well served by editing for anachronistic language.",The King,2019-11-01,7.2,91682,2019
tt7984766,2,"Let's get the simple stuff out of the way first:1) The people who made this film have never cracked a history book in their lives. They don't know anything about the period the film is set in, or the real people and real events they were trying to portray. Apart from getting some people's names and a couple of locations right, they fail at literally everything. It would actually be hard to get this much wrong if you weren't deliberately trying to do so. With so much going on, statistically one would be likely to get more right simply by chance if the script were being handled by chimpanzees.Shakespeare took his share of liberties with the story of Henry V, but then, his audience was literally Henry's descendants, so he had a particular motivation to portray things in a certain light. One cannot imagine what the writers of this mess had as motivation. The story they are telling is supposedly a blend of history and Shakespeare, but they utterly fail at being faithful to either the events or the spirit of both. I suppose I could have just left this portion of the review at ""they utterly fail.""Agincourt, the battle on which the entire story revolves, was a brilliant and incredibly dramatic battle. A faithful depiction of the battle would have cost no more resources, been no more difficult to portray or for the audience to follow, and would have been vastly more visually impressive and dramatically impactful than the bout of silly fantasy we are instead treated to. If you watched that and thought, ""This is what a medieval battle would really look like,"" your education is lacking and you should consider picking up one of Bernard Cornwell's excellent novels of the period as a primer.2) I cannot for the life of me fathom why there are two 21st century characters shoehorned into the middle of this 15th century story. It's not just that Prince Hal/Henry V does not even remotely resemble the real person- it's that even if this were a made up character in a fantasy tale he would still appear six centuries out of place. He is entirely composed of silly 21st century notions about kingship, war, relationships, etc. And Catherine of Valois is even more ridiculous than he is. ""All monarchy is illegitimate,"" says the future queen. If that wasn't a laugh line, I don't know why they included it.3) I could go on, but this is getting long already, so I'll summarize. The pacing is awful, the dialogue is often painful. I'm not one of those who enjoys Shakespearean language (I'd rather have a faithful modern version of the wording), but at least Shakespeare's dialogue is intelligent, unlike this nonsense. Some of the performances would probably have been impressive if they hadn't been wading through such utter nonsense. And why is Falsaff here? He's a fictional character ripped from Shakespeare, but entirely divorced from the actual Shakespearean character. He simply makes no sense, despite Joel Edgerton's herculean efforts.In short, fools may like this film, but it is bad history, abysmal Shakespeare, and poor film making. I highly recommend watching Henry V (1998) instead, for a much better telling of a similar story.",The King,2019-11-01,7.2,91682,2019

tt7984766,5,"The picture is good. But it is very disappointing that half a millennium after Shakespeare, the authors of the film made familiar images much more flat. The point is not even the grimacing Pattinson, diligently depicting a parody of a French accent. Not in Catherine Valois, who speaks to the crowned groom as a modern feminist (in the play, and in medieval life, she could only refuse to kiss before the wedding). It can be forgiven - after all, Shakespeare's ""Henry the Fifth"" is just a kind of propaganda, well below his true masterpieces. But the authors raised their hand to the most sacred - Sir John Falstaff. In my opinion, this is the best character created by the genius from Stratford. Funny and disrespected coward, drunkard and chatterbox was, nevertheless, a figure of tremendous charm, easily overshadowing other heroes. And yet, despite his weaknesses, he was wholeheartedly attached to the prince. When the young king breaks with the past, rudely treating the old knight, this decision can be considered fair, but you still sympathize with Falstaff. A comic jester suddenly turns out to be a deep tragic hero, and the death of the abandoned and forgotten Sir John becomes the most touching moment of the ""sequel"" to the brilliant ""Henry the Fourth"". As one of critics rightly noted, Shakespeare killed this character primarily because ""the public's sympathies for Falstaff's humor could not be reconciled with the idea of statehood, which logically was supposed to complete the play."" However, ""Henry the Fifth"" as a work of art is not comparable with its predecessor, so Sir John Falstaff with all his vices finally won, as life always ultimately defeats the cold state machine.
What do we see in this movie? The director turned an old cowardly drunkard into a wise, laconic warrior and a brilliant strategist, whom Henry the Fifth draws closer to himself and puts him at the head of his army. The French are defeated. And with them, the author buried Shakespeare in the mud too. As a result, we have a nice plot, from which hardly anyone's heart will get pinched, and which will be forgotten in a couple of days.",The King,2019-11-01,7.2,91682,2019

Some actually important stuff just happens off-screen.The finale is disappointing and unspectacular and also the special effects are super whacky.

tt1025100,4,"Not content for the high frame rate (HFR) stereoscopic technology which he first experimented with in 2016's 'Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk' to be a one-hit wonder, Ang Lee employs the same method in this science-fiction action thriller to give it the same pin-sharp clarity. The impact is plainly apparent right from the start if viewed in the HFR 3D format - not only are we led to observe an astonishing extent of visual minutiae in the opening scenes where Will Smith's special-forces assassin Henry Brogan positions himself atop a grassy knoll to assassinate his target on board an express train, the crispness and clarity of the images are startling to say the least, although some may not be quite so enamoured with the effect.Regardless, there will probably be no argument that the most stunning technological achievement here is the digital de-aging of Smith, which allows the 51-year-old actor to play a character 25 years younger than he is. Junior, as that character is named here, is a clone created by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) operative Clay Varris (Clive Owen) under the ethically suspect 'Gemini project', which aims to manufacture biotech warriors to fight our wars for us. Specifically for Junior though, Clay has been raising him as his adopted son, in the hopes that he may equal Brogan at his own game one day - and that game so happens to be the business of sharpshooting, which Brogan has demonstrated his prowess in through 72 unblemished kills for the DIA and is now more than ready to retire from.That, in essence, is the premise of 'Gemini Man', which has been languishing in development since the 1990s and passed through the likes of Harrison Ford, Clint Eastwood and Sean Connery before finding its lead in Smith. Thanks to the contributions of Weta Digital, Lee has accomplished what the late director Tony Scott never managed to, although we suspect that achievement will likely be lost on an audience who will wonder why all those years evolving the technology was not similarly spent on developing its undercooked script (credited to three distinguished Hollywood veterans no less, including 'Game of Thrones' creator David Benioff and 'The Hunger Games' co-writer Billy Ray).As appealing as the idea of an aging hitman who is targeted by a younger clone of himself may sound, the very concept itself is flawed - indeed, it doesn't take a genius to realise that just because two individuals have the same DNA means they will possess the same abilities. That logic gap would have been easier to ignore if the movie itself were simply a popcorn blockbuster; unfortunately, it also figures itself to be a thinking-man's thriller about the age-old debate between Nature and Nurture. Indeed, rather than kill each other outright, Brogan decides to engage in a cat-and-mouse game with Junior, believing that Junior could very well be a different person if he knew the truth about his origins.Why Brogan would hold a soft spot for his clone is never satisfactorily explained during the movie or even at the end, except to allow the storytelling to pit Smith against Smith and then to have two of them go up against Owen's resident villain. Yet because Owen is not an action star, the finale turns out underwhelming, leaving only the two set-pieces involving a battle of Wills to hold your attention. Thankfully, owing to Lee's deft staging, they are pretty amazing to watch - one of them takes place against the picturesque streets of Columbia, unfolding along its rooftops before culminating in a dizzying motorcycle chase; and the other happens in the underlit catacombs of Budapest, where both men engage in a furious exchange of kicks and punches before one of them almost drowns the other.Even so, these sequences are not enough to compensate for the sheer inertness of the rest of the movie, which comprises of weak banter and plenty of thudding exposition. Despite roping in Mary Elizabeth Winstead as a fellow rogue DIA agent and Benedict Wong as a wise-cracking pilot sidekick, there is hardly any fun to be had in their team dynamics (unlike say that between Tom Cruise, Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg in 'Mission Impossible - Fallout'), no thanks to the leaden dialogue. Not only is the science highly suspect, the whole narrative itself is frustratingly thin, with the barest of excuses why they have to go from Columbia to Hungary before heading back to Georgia, or even how they can somehow borrow a Gulfstream jet to fly them from country to country.In fact, we'd dare say you'll be bored stiff during the two-hour duration, because other than the action, there is little momentum to the storytelling at all. Lee's attempt at fleshing out Brogan and Junior's respective reckoning falls embarrassingly flat, not so much because Smith doesn't try his best to emote both ways (and we mean both here because he plays both characters), but rather because the character development here is so blunt it hardly even matters. Whether deliberate or otherwise, the fact that the movie pretty much revolves around these five roles (Smith, Smith Jr, Winstead, Wong and Owen) is even less excuse for the sheer laziness in the scripting, both in terms of plot and character.Much as we'd love to embrace Lee's techniques here, 'Gemini Man' is ultimately a high-concept misfire. Like we said, the very premise itself is flawed, and the rest of the movie does itself no favours by thinking itself smarter and more intelligent than it really is; worse still, it doesn't even much try to be credible, which neither Smith's charisma or Lee's filmmaking ingenuity can compensate for. Oh yes, the HFR realism and digital fakery are novel probably for the first 10 minutes, but soon wears off and reveals instead the artificiality and superficiality of the whole enterprise. It may sound appealing to have two Smiths in the same movie, but you'd wish they'd went right back to the genesis of this project and change up the whole DNA of this dull, almost lifeless, big-budget failure.",Gemini Man,2019-10-11,5.7,90323,2019

Young Will Smith is probably the best looking CGI de-aging effect I've seen in a film (until the last scene).
The cinematography was also really well-done, there are some interesting shots, especially one panoramic shot of a train whizzing by. And shots hold for much longer than the typical action film, often showing impressive long-take shots.
The action is tense, with hard-hitting fight choregoraphy, as opposed to the ""cut away"" style many modern action films go with.
Will Smith, both young and old, delivers a very good performance as assassins struggling with their identity & place in the world, albeit in very different circumstances.

The assassin who stalks him has a very familiar feel to him...Lets not beat around the bush, Smith and Winstead deserve a better screenplay than this. The writing is weak and lazy, Lee is clearly the wrong director for such a high concept action film, while the action scenes are shoddy in effects. In fact the storyline, as trite as it is, is unfairly in a constant battle against the CGI on show.However, film never sits still and refuses to let boredom take a hold. The lead actors are engaging enough to hold attention throughout, and even as the sugary coatings fill out the final throes, we at least can acknowledge there were earnest intentions to make an existential clone thriller here. But with Jerry Bruckheimer on production you can see there's a popcorn action film trying to break free of the literary treacle.Hardly the worst clone sci-fier that some have called it, but it's not memorable either.

Hug your enemies (never mind that the blue fairy is now just a pot of flower and half of the near-extinct dark feys are gone)!I literally cringed the entire 2/3 of the movie because of how oblivious everyone is; it's like nobody gives a damn about what just happened.

tt4777008,4,"First of all, I have to say that I am a big fan of the first movie (despite all its flaws), and I am sad to see a franchise with such a great potential be ruined so badly. I wish I didn't have to write this review, but seeing all the positivity being spread around made me want to share a bit of objective criticism.There are three main issues with this movie that poke my nerve really badly.Firstly, the trailer and the title. Both are very misleading, luring the adult audience into thinking Maleficent will go through a Joker-like phase and actually do some evil. Well, the evilest thing we got is stopping a cat mid-air and threatening to kill it, as far as I'm concerned. She didn't even kill the queen (who actually deserved it) just because Aurora gets in the way. What evil are we even talking about?The second thing that bothers me is trying to base a children's movie on war and genocide. I don't know who ever thought of that, but those two things just don't work together. Everything is sugar-coated, and absolutely no realism is presented throughout the movie. Literally no one thought that the two kingdoms could come together except for Phillip and Aurora, the idealistic and naive couple with no experience in the real world politics. (The beginning of the movie is actually a joke that writes itself!) Moreover, the elf that has been aggressive throughout the whole movie suddenly stops after a few kind words from an enemy prince? Give me a break. There are just so many plot incoveniences that stem from trying to make adult themes appropriate for children that it turns the movie into a parody rather than a believable story.Lastly, the writing is just bad... I can't get over the fact that Maleficent has been guarding Aurora her whole life and the girl decides to believe the queen she met five minutes ago. Phillip is utterly useless, he couldn't even tell the court people that Maleficent doesn't stand iron. Also, remember that curse from the first movie that apparently can't be broken? Well, that is not a thing anymore.There are few words that can describe the disappointment I felt after Maleficent resurrected herself on the top of that tower... Finally, I thought when she died, there is the plot twist we were waiting for! But no, because the protagonist in a children's movie simply can't die. And together with the immortality Maleficent gained, she also lost a large chunk of her character and future potential. Remember Jolie's expression when Maleficent found our her wings were cut off in the first movie? That scene gave me chills. Now when Maleficent is practically untouchable, it is a question whether we will get a great scene like that anymore.Let's talk about the queen. In my opinion, she is probably the most developed character in the whole movie. Yes, she may be evil; but her motivation is on point, her hatred towards the moor is justified and the strategy to conquer it almost flawless. She is the only character besides Maleficent that understands the complexity of politics and has no problem putting Phillip in his rightful place. Since this is a children's movie, I honestly expected her to die as well as Stefan did in the first movie, but they didn't even do that... they just turned her into a goat. By the way, Pfeiffer's cold face suits the role perfectly and the costumography is absolutely stunning.If I had to choose one scene that stuck with me the most, it would definitely be the dinner. Little do we know about the queen until then, but the way she makes Maleficent uncomfortable quickly and clearly lets us know what kind of a foe she is. Angelina and Michelle both did an astounding job portraying their respective characters and it was a true pleasure to feel the onscreen tension between them.To summarize, Maleficent: Mistress of Evil is a movie that was stripped away from its dignity by writers who clearly do not understand that war is not a theme appropriate for children. As much as I loved the first movie, I wouldn't recommend this one to anyone interested in more than two hours of fun. Hopefully Disney will one day start caring about quality of their movies rather than making money... Such a shame.",Maleficent: Mistress of Evil,2019-10-18,6.6,87070,2019
tt4777008,4,"I'll start off by saying, the film looks beautiful but that is where it ends. The film has some serious story problems. It tries to be Game Of Thrones for children but falls very flat due to its 2 hour run time. Despite the film being called 'Maleficent: Mistress of Evil' there is very little Maleficent in the film and the short period of time she is in it, she definitely isn't evil. Michelle Pfeiffer is a great villian and is the glue that holds this film together. The end to this film is a massive battle with a huge body count and is resolved within minutes because of a wedding.

tt4777008,1,"Wow, what a slap in the face of the empowering women and feminism message of the first movie!1. Princess Aurora: A faithless airhead, incompetent ruler and heartless self-centered mannequin.2. Queen Ingrith: A way and means of having the movie's villain hurt the two female main characters without the public crying ""mysogyny!""3. Maleficent: Demoted to supporting character and rushed out of the way of the main plot relegated to ""finding herself"" among her newly discovered fellow winged-and-horned dark fae.So the majority of Maleficent's native race, already on the verge of dying out, got wiped out in one fell swoop. Plus - since supposedly all the Moor's population got trapped in the church and shot like fish in a barrel - a huge lot of them got taken out as well. Including one of Aurora's three ""aunties"". No matter, let's take the hands of the very people who reduced fairyland's population to a mere fraction of its original size and LET'S HAVE A WEDDING! We're now all friends here!What a trio of ""strong women"". Either pretty, self-centered and useless, or scheming and evil (and coming to no good end, of course).Thank you, Disney.

tt4777008,7,"In 2014, audiences learnt the back-story behind Maleficent, the villainess of Disney's 1959 animated film Sleeping Beauty. Rather than being just a cackling sorceress, Maleficent painted its title character as someone who rose from tragedy and betrayal to form a complex bond with the young Princess Aurora. Directed by Joachim Rønning (Pirates of the Caribbean: Salazar's Revenge), this sequel continues that story, pitting Maleficent against a conniving, ruthless new foe.Angelina Jolie continues to be all sharp-cheekboned perfection as Maleficent. We were afraid that she might phone in it given that this is a sequel, but she still appears to relish the role. Not only does she gets numerous fabulous costume changes, Maleficent goes on a journey of discovering, getting acquainted with her people and learning about their customs and beliefs. There is a conflict between her allegiance to her fae kin and to Aurora, which gives the powerful character something to struggle with.Much of the film works because of Michelle Pfeiffer. Casting her opposite Jolie was an inspired move. The early promotional materials tried to hide it, but there's no point beating about the bush now - Queen Ingrith is the ""Mistress of Evil"" of the title. Pfeiffer plays the villain with sneer and swagger hidden beneath a regal façade, with shades of her witch character from Stardust sometimes visible. Coming off like a PG-rated Cersei Lannister, it's an absolute hoot.There's a lot going on in the plot of the movie, so it is to writers Linda Woolverton, Noah Harpster and Micah Fitzerman-Blue's credit that the movie never loses sight of its emotional core: the relationship between Maleficent and Aurora. They might not be on the same page for much of the film, but it cannot be questioned that Maleficent deeply loves and cares for Aurora, something Ingrith winds up exploiting.Just as in the first film, the show is stolen by Sam Riley as Diaval, Maleficent's shape-shifting sidekick. Riley manages to be both cool andWhile the visuals are often mesmerising and transporting, the film does lean very heavily on computer-generated imagery. This is expected of a fantasy adventure film, but some of the characters do seem unnatural. The Fairy Godmothers Knotgrass (Imelda Staunton), Thistlewit (Juno Temple) and Flittle (Lesley Manville) return from the first film, and their almost-human facial features sometimes cross over into the dreaded uncanny valley.Prince Philip is boring, but then again, this is something inherent in the source material. Brenton Thwaites, who was busy filming Season 2 of Titans, is replaced by Harris Dickinson, who constantly seems a little bit confused and flat. However, this is also a sign that the film understands that Philip is not the main character, and that he does not have to be the hero to save the day.
Chiwetel Ejiofor is almost completely wasted in a relatively small supporting role.The action sequences in Maleficent: Mistress of Evil are grand and expansive. Like most big-budget high fantasy projects these days, it seems more than a little derivative of Game of Thrones, but the big battle scenes are dynamic and lively. The movie gets surprisingly dark, with the villain's plot involving genocide by way of biological warfare. However, the movie still has a bounce and a sense of humour to it and is never too self-serious the way something like Snow White and the Huntsman and its sequel The Huntsman: Winter's War sometimes were. The big climactic battle takes place in broad daylight, which is a relative rarity in films of this type.This film has a completely different design team than the first but maintains a sense of visual continuity while also giving us something new. The costumes by Ellen Mirojnick are stunning, especially Maleficent's battle outfit which is a sexy, elegant body paint-style number. Production designer Patrick Tatopolous creates some gorgeous fantasy environments, chief of which is the hidden fae sanctuary comprising mini-environments which have different climates.Some of it may be overly familiar, but there's still more creativity to this than to Disney's live-action remakes which are obligated to retrace the steps of their animated forebears. Angelina Jolie and Michelle Pfeiffer pitted against each other is worth the price of admission.",Maleficent: Mistress of Evil,2019-10-18,6.6,87070,2019

tt5503686,6,"My primary thought is that I'm happy someone made a film that shines a spotlight on a very serious problem currently becoming more common amongst sex workers. As a sex worker myself, I am exposed to the perspectives and activities of a wide array of sex workers on a daily basis. I have observed an increasing amount of sex workers who feel validated in their decisions to become con-artists, bragging proudly about robbing their own clients. While I'm happy that this is starting to be discussed in the mainstream media, that doesn't mean it's a pleasant thing to observe. It's tragic that in an era when sex work does seem to be getting to a place where it's more openly accepted, we have unabashed behavior like this which is going to make people second guess any progress we may have established thus far - it's heavily counterproductive. Overall, the movie mostly just made me feel frustrated, sad, and worried for the future - but it was the correlation to reality that I couldn't get off of my mind. I wasn't very enveloped in the world of the film itself - mostly just reminded of my worries regarding the industry and the way it's pupils and society will carry on being effected by on another from here on out.As a film alone, it was okay. The performances were sufficient but nothing that stood out, which is more a result of the writing. Uninteresting characters caught up in uninteresting events. Overall, the plot FEELS like it should be entertaining, but the movie is a bit redundant - once you get into the thick of it, you're basically watching a repetitive cycle with not much movement to it. And as it goes on, you kind of like the characters less and less, with no real conflicting energies - so it kind of just gets worse as it goes. The movie could have use some cutting - there's not enough depth or complexity to it to validate a nearly 2 hour run time, unfortunately.The movie did have a handful of very amusing moments, but it was not enough to redeem the thing as a whole.

tt5503686,3,"So, I went to see this film because I read it somewhere that they were getting nominated for awards. Now that I have seen it, no way could I believe that this film was to be nominated for anything...
The script is poorly constructed and poorly written. The acting is ok, but, no amount of acting can help a poor script... I heard it said that the story was empowering to women, well, nope, there's definitely none of that.
I think the fundamental problem with this film is that there doesn't seem to be a point to the story they're trying to tell. Here, we have a group of underprivileged people, struggling in elements beyond their control, trying to make the best out of their situation. So what do they do? Well, they go around stabbing other people in the back in order to save themselves.
Still, if they had done it with class, with beauty, with some sort of deserving effort, then, maybe there could have been a story in it, a story worthy of being told. But, we don't see any of that in this film.
Contrary to how their marketing is trying to spin it, there is nothing empowering about it, this group of people remains powerless from the beginning to the end. There's no Robin hood in these scenarios, there's no justice restored. The truly powerful aren't going to be affected by them, it's just other victims who fall victims to these victims (of their circumstances).
Now, the film does go into the back stories of the main characters, perhaps trying to make sense of how they come to be slipping down this ultimate path. But, there's just so little substance in the background, they just come across as common excuses, ""well, I was struggling, and I needed money""...",Hustlers,2019-09-13,6.3,85434,2019

You were meant to feel uncomfortable with the decisions they made. It's not a movie about girl power. It's about these women reacting to the circumstances they were put in.The great thing about it is that it is solely focused on the women and their stories.

Here's what I thought was missing and didn't make sense. The 20/20 documentary gave me more insight than the movie. I had more respect for these women. They were like the wolf on Wall Street, three women hustling Wall Street men out of their credit cards. But watching the movie I didn't see that. There were good laughs here and there but I walked away without a complete story. This movie had too many big names and wasn't focusing on the storytelling. If this film had did more research and took more time, this could have been bigger than wolf on Wall Street. Their story was in a continuous loop of the crime rather than getting to the root of why it really started in the first place.

The co-leads in Constance Wu (Crazy Rich Asians) and Jennifer Lopez (Jenny from the block...) act their asses off. For a $20 million production this film looks huge and glossy. It's everything you want your trip to the movies to be. Worth the price of admission and engaging enough to justify the large coke and popcorn.I felt like for a portion of the film that some characters were forgotten about. They felt key to the character's motivations but went missing. These threads were picked up again however and it resolved my biggest gripe. The cast is quite large especially during the films first act. More and more cast members are added as the film progresses and the initial ensemble is made redundant by the plot. The girls were so charming at the start that I wish they'd found their way back into the story. This isn't a criticism so much as a wish for more of a good thing.My experience seeing this movie was my main takeaway. I'm a self-professed film geek. Often when I head to the pictures I'm flying solo because my One Sixty cohort Shane is busy or finding like minded film fans is hard to come by where live. It's not uncommon to see a few other guys watching the film by themselves as well. What I saw during Hustlers was sort of unprecedented out in the 'burbs where I live (at least in my experience). I saw many women, by themselves, in the cinema seeking this film. Young and old alike.It's no great mystery that movies are made, at least marketed, with men/boys in mind. Great inroads have been made in changing the opinion that they are solely for men and Hustlers seems like a huge leap forward in defeating this stigma. Whilst I was watching the movie the sense that this movie wasn't trying to appeal to my more basic man-brain became increasingly apparent. The movie wasn't exploitive of its female cast. It told the story as it was, it didn't fantasise.I felt refreshed seeing a movie that I wasn't the target audience for. Seeing a movie that could easily have fallen into the trappings of becoming a male fantasy movie. Instead it was a female story. Told as it was. I am absolutely here for more mature movies that aren't just about the white male experience. As his history shows in order for anything to survive becoming stagnated it need diversity.

I doubt they ever actually watched the movie and this is just the fashionably offended looking for something to complain about. The movie is an action masterpiece.Formulaic? Yes but the sheer grit and psychotic rage emanated by John Rambo in this film is a step above what we have seen from him in the past.
It's a culmination of every injustice, every disappointment and every cauterized bullet wound channelled into revenge for one too many unwanted grievance. The camel's back has broken and it is blood that will pour through the flood gates.

tt1206885,9,"I felt compelled to write this review after reading the backlash this movie has received of being racist and unnecessarily violent. I'm Mexican, I saw this movie in a cinema obviously filled with Mexicans.. no one felt offended!!!! Everyone was cheering towards the end and that final montage hit the feelings note perfectly. Rambo is a character embedded deeply in Mexican pop culture as well as in many other countries, and it hurts me to say it, but the villains you see in this movie is a reality that happens in my country, if anything I congratulate Stallone for denouncing that criminal activity. It's not a perfect movie, and it does have a different feeling than the other ones, but when Rambo finally appears you'll feel it and at his most cold blooded self he can be, the violence while gruesome, I didn't feel it unnecesary especially if you know how this Criminal Bands operate.

tt1206885,10,"Growing up watching the Rambo movies in the 80's many times over, I was excited when Rambo returned in 2008. It was a very emotional movie, with Rambo angrier and more brutal than ever.
With the box office success of that film, I've patiently waited for the 5th installment, and here it finally is.
I decided last minute to go see this thing on it's opening night... the theater was nearly 70 percent full. Everyone in anticipation for what will probably be the last chapter in the John Rambo saga.
It's a different Rambo film... no police pushing Rambo out of town. No Russians or Vietnamese to tangle with. This Rambo really, really just wants to live a clam life that perhaps he always wanted. The guy is even on medication to help him stay cool, but, there is the evil in the darkness that wishes to torment an already tormented soul, and that soul is John Rambo.
He seems really content with his new life with his adopted family. He has a beautiful young girl in his life, who calls him Uncle John lovingly. In all honesty, I wouldn't have minded a complete film on the relationship building of the people that are in his life. Just John on the farm with his family. Raising the young girl and seeing her grow into a young lady that will soon be off to college. Rambo is very proud of her, and protecting, but she has a demon in her past too, and it's her father that has left her and moved back to Mexico. As with most children that have been abandoned by their paternal parents, she yearns to see her father and ask him the one question that eats her alive.
""Why did you leave my mother and I?""
A question she soon regrets she ever traveled all the way to Mexico to ask her father. In doing so, she has betrayed her families trust, but Rambo loves her and becomes hell bent to save her from the cartels.
Without giving too much away, when Rambo finally sees her again to save her, it is bittersweet. He has invested his last ten years into this young girl and to see what happens to her, (and in real life) happens to so many human trafficking victims with pull the tears and your heart strings.
When you wipe away the tears, you find a completely unhinged Rambo that takes out the bad guys with a rage like no other. Bare hand bashing, hammers used to break skulls, shotgun blasts, decapitations, knives to just about every part of the human body you can imagine.
How the hell Stallone keeps the action sequences so fresh after nearly 40 years is beyond me.
Is there moments of redundancy in the film, yes, but not overly... and as an action film, a complete 10.
Go for a blood bath of ecstacy and get ready to hold on for one hell of an action packed ride.",Rambo: Last Blood,2019-09-20,6.1,83732,2019
tt1206885,7,"Rambo Last Blood (2019)At 73, most people prefer to sit at home, relax and reminisce their youth while being surrounded by their family. Sylvester Stallone was not built that way and this year he made a movie to prove that action stars of the 80s simply don't age. Obviously he has lost a step or two and is not flying around the screen like he used to but at bloody 73, he is still a one man army and the living proof that age is just a number.Rambo Last Blood is a no nonsense grim action movie with a cliche plot that does not pretend be bigger than it is. Nobody is saving the world from mass enslavement, spies or nuclear threats. It is a simple revenge thriller with loads of action, grit and violence that can easily rival John Wick in terms of creativity. Stallone is a lone wolf who still has sharp fangs despite his gray hair and his enemies will find out just how sharp these fangs are.Very similar to previous Rambo films, just on a smaller scale, so it goes without saying that if you are a fan of the franchise, 80-90s action or Stallone in general then you will feel right at home. Fast pace, simple narrative, grim settings and plently of violence give Last Blood a genuine throwback feel to the golden days of action.#moviesshmovies on Instagram",Rambo: Last Blood,2019-09-20,6.1,83732,2019

Rambo 5: MOTIVATED TO KILL 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸Rambo: Last Blood is a hollow, self-contained sequel that manages to be both inconsistent and completely unnecessary for the character. The main plot points are so brief and uninspired that I am not sure why they didn't just cut out the entire first hour and summarize it in a cue card at the beginning. The girl who gets captured is a brand new, unknown, stubborn, and unlikable character made up for this film, essentially so she can be used as a prop to provoke Rambo's rage. This would have been forgivable had the film been honest about not wanting to do the drama and just jumped into the action. Instead we get a half-baked and uninteresting first hour trying to convince us why Rambo should care about her.The film takes a bloodlust angle. Having just watched the first four installments, this is inconsistent to a degree with his character in that it's the only Rambo where he is actually motivated inside himself to go kill-rather than a victim to the system used and exploited for his supersoldier training in a way that places him in a moral dilemma he cannot refuse, like how it always has been with every other Rambo film.Some are calling this MAGA: The Movie. There is a 20-second sequence where John Rambo goes rogue and is crossing the US-Mexico border back into the United States. He stops his truck at a flimsy little wooden fence in a field in the middle of the night, then rams the truck through the fence with ease. He goes on to lure a group of Mexican criminals, rapists, gang members, & murderers across the border to trespass onto his property where he proceeds to gun them down one by one. This film is every xenophobe's fantasy. The final half hour is just a series of deaths the enemies walk right into without any kind of resistance or forethought. Rambo is not challenged whatsoever. It is simply a massacre, like watching an old man slaughter goats.One redeeming quality of this film is the score from Brian Tyler. He takes Rambo's Battle Adagio theme from the previous film and mixes in some A Monster Calls (Fernando Velàzquez) and LOTR (Howard Shore). This song takes place in a memorable scene just before the Trump wall advertisement.Last Blood is legitimately not a good Rambo film. It isn't quite ""pretend it never existed"" bad, but it is quite a step back after the large step forward that was the previous installment.Disappointed.",Rambo: Last Blood,2019-09-20,6.1,83732,2019
tt1206885,9,"So I must admit I didnt have very high hopes going in to see this movie, the idea of a man in his 70's playing this kind of character combined with the critics scores (which at the moment are appalling low) made me think this would not turn out to be a good film. I was very wrong I am happy to say.Just like the first movie in the series this movie has a very important lesson embedded in a very gritty and entertaining story. I dont wish to include spoilers in this review so i will just say in that regard that the story revolves around the naivety of youth brought up in a secure environment and just not understanding the brutality of the real world and the consequences that can have.This movie is fairly gory which is not normally my thing but in the context of a story looking to highlight the brutal realities it has an important part to play in really bringing that home to the viewer.I have to say this was a great all round movie and if this is indeed the final chapter for the Rambo character I think it really went out with a bang.

tt1206885,8,"OK, so I have to admit: I can't help but love Sly Stallone. The guy just keeps coming back succesfully, against all odds. Who would have thought that he could pull off another Rambo flick at age 73? Well, I'm glad he did, because besides Liam Neeson, Denzel Washington and Mel Gibson, who are we gonna turn to for some old school, old-man-on-a-revenge-spree flick?I was a big fan of First Blood, but didn't care so much for the second (too cartoonish) and third (too friggin' awful) installments. The fourth however, was just amazing. A slow build up, a suspenseful breakout and then cathartic violence. That last action sequence, where Rambo goes totally berserk and makes minced meat out of a whole army, I mean, come on, that was awesome.The fifth Rambo is a little different in that it is more of a generic revenge flick in its setup. But only in its setup though. As soon as Rambo starts maiming and killing, this movie goes so far over the top you can't help but cheer him on. This is one bloody movie. Last blood it may be, but it is many a full bucket of it.I also like how Rambo is more vulnarable in this flick. Stallone gets to use more of his acting chops in this one.I know it's a lot to ask, and maybe I shouldn't even hope for it, but damn it, I sure would like another one of these.",Rambo: Last Blood,2019-09-20,6.1,83732,2019

It's the Logan (2017) of the Rambo Series and I was very impressed with everything about this Movie. The best film in the Rambo franchise since First Blood, the curiously titled Rambo: Last Blood injects the heart back into the legendary action franchise, before ripping it out with an awe-inspiring avalanche of violence that re-establishes Sylvester Stallone as an action hero with equal. If on screen kills are an art, that what Last Blood delivers is a masterpiece. A deluge of bloody ferocious brutality, delivered with trademark Sly snarl and thankfully shaky-cam free, the violence of Last Blood more than matches the recent output from other one-man army movies.Suitably excessive in execution and wince inducing in its means, it's the kind of action filmmaking that hardcore fans would especially appreciate. Much like the Creed films, Rambo: Last Blood successfully replicates the heart and spirit of how its franchise operates at the best level. John J.

tt1206885,5,"Although this type of kidnapping story has been done many times before, Last Blood starts out pretty good.John has retired and spends his time taking care of his adopted family, rescuing some people and prepping for the next world war. When his daughter gets taken in Mexico and forced into prostitution Rambo has to go save her.This movie succeeds in showing the ruthlessness of these cartels and the horrible situation these girls live in. I really liked the bond with his family and the idea of him having to take this Cartel on in an Urban environment.Unfortunately that did not happen... Instead he just stupidly walks up to te cartel leaders house, gets cornered by 50 or so armed guys and only survives because the guy in charge is an idiot.After recovering for a few days he just walks into some brothel with a hammer murders a few people and rescues his daughter without any resistance.
-Can someone explain why this is suddenly super easy? When they know exactly who he is and who he is looking for!?Then after all this trouble... She dies and it becomes a revenge story.Rambo murders one of the brothers and the entire cartel follows him to his to his house where he installed some fun surprises for them. The fight starts like some good old Rambo fun, but then everyone just keeps running into every single trap like some gruesome home alone movie... The whole fight only takes 10 minutes or so and it seems like there trying to cover up the stupidity in gore and blood. Then when everybody is dead he blows everything up, what he could have done from the start, rips the guys hard out and dies...Disappointing story, bad decisions and very few good action scenes.

tt1206885,4,"The Rambo franchise hasn't been known for its subtleties and that was proven when Sylvestre Stallone returned to the role back in 2008. The amount of violence throughout that film gave action junkies everything they were asking for. It also took the outrageously bloody aspect of the franchise to another level as well. Wrapped up in a nice bow by the time the credits rolled, 2008s Rambo seemed to be the finale. Well, apparently not, as Rambo: Last Blood is now in theatres. Sadly, this franchise definitely should have ended with the previous instalment. Here's why I believe this movie simply doesn't work.Now retired and taking care of a ranch out in the county, John Rambo has evolved into a (seemingly) much calmer man. After his niece makes a poor decision to find out the truth of who her real father has become out in Mexico, all hell breaks loose as John finds himself on the hunt to save his family. Without ruining anything, one thing leads to another and he eventually needs to use his home as a giant war zone/booby-trap to fend off his enemies. In theory, this premise is a great set-up for an action film that simply wants to focus on the action itself, but it really doesn't feel anything like a Rambo movie.Being a war veteran and fending off his enemies throughout the course of his entire life, John Rambo is a character with a lot of complexities. For this reason alone, many of the Rambo films have been able to tell interesting stories, even if the execution wasn't always there. This time around, he has become a family man and an emotional tie is what gets him back in the game. The finale of this movie is the only remotely entertaining aspect, but the set-up for it just felt like an excuse for a revenge movie, which is never truly what the Rambo films have been.Stallone is committed to this character as always and Yvette Monreal as his niece is actually quite good, but their dynamic just felt like it belonged in another movie. With the addition of some very cheesy dialogue at times and the fact that John Rambo is the only one who feels like a real, fleshed-out character, I found myself not really caring about what happened to anyone here. That said, audiences who watch Rambo movies are usually there for the action anyways, and if you're a fan of gory violence that's done well, then the final 20 minutes may be enough for you.In the end, Rambo: Last Blood is a mixture of elements from movies like Taken and Home Alone, with an elderly war hero at the forefront and the violence cranked up to a thousand. There are moments of enjoyment and even a few times where I was having a little fun, but it really is an emotional movie that doesn't feel earned. It asks you to care about characters that haven't been around for much of the franchise and I just couldn't buy it. For die-hard fans of the franchise, maybe check it out once it's available to rent or buy at home, but I really don't think it's worth your time.",Rambo: Last Blood,2019-09-20,6.1,83732,2019
tt1206885,4,"So the plot is just a Mexican version of Taken. Stallone did a good job, he's still in great shape. It's not a long movie and it's not boring, but this was not a Rambo movie to me; just a guy going on a murder rampage. I feel like this did not do justice to conclude the Rambo series.",Rambo: Last Blood,2019-09-20,6.1,83732,2019
tt1206885,1,"The last time I walked out of a movie was Seth Rogen's ""Observe and Report"". Sadly, I stayed for the end of Last Blood.There is nothing here of the haunted soldier from First Blood. Nothing of the man who just wanted to be left alone and resorted to violence only when there was no other option. Honestly, John Rambo would have been better off dying at the end of that film as the original author had intended rather than living for this. What we get instead is a flat, random tough guy who could be anyone.Spoilers followRambo is now living in Arizona on a ranch where there are no trees and he's built a network of underground tunnels that appear to go nowhere but criss-cross each other frequently and randomly. He lets no one go into them until the granddaughter of his housekeeper wants to have a party and show them off to her friends. It makes no sense at the time, and isn't referenced again.The girl goes on a hunt for her biological father who abandoned her when she was an infant. He's a bad guy as Rambo observes but she goes off to find him anyway. Many really bad things happen to her, so Rambo goes down to get her back, except he doesn't actually know what her situation is. He just dives right in with gusto and apparently a lifetime of bitter anger, maiming numerous people on his search for the girl. He wanders right into their stronghold and gets beaten severely by about 40 guys. This, as I said, is not John Rambo.He recovers and THEN decides to go after these guys in a surgical fashion. Where was this tactical expertise just a few days ago? He saves the girl, whose situation isn't good. He just left a woman who wanted to help him and who knew a doctor, but instead of trying to get the girl some help, he just proceeds to drive her home. She dies because he'd rather get her home than find her a doctor to get her some Narcan. Yes, she's dead because this Rambo is a moron.He goes back, provokes the bad guys with more killings and a decapitation which features our ""hero"" dropping a head out the window of his pickup by its hair only to bounce down the road as he speeds away. This of course draws them to our side of The Wall (which features in several scenes) and to Rambo's ranch before the big showdown in the tunnels. Many booby traps (but inexplicably, after each one triggers, there's Rambo delivering the death blow or some gratuitous extra bullets) later and we realize that the whole point of the tunnels was to have a place to fight random bad guys he might one day want to bring back to Arizona. Good plan.In the end, he blows the tunnels, goes all Temple of Doom on the lead bad guy, and literally rides off into the sunset.I felt degraded, nauseated, and disappointed. The dialog was worthy of an after-school special from the 70s. The shot selection wasn't much better. So many closeups. So many. The violence was right out of Hostel or Saw or any other torture porn film you might care to reference. I actually snorted out loud a few times though whether from revulsion or humor or just the whole absurdity of the thing, I can't be sure.This was not a Rambo movie. It had no soul, no depth, no gravitas. It was just a revenge & violence fantasy against Mexican traffickers & drug cartels with so many bad decisions from the good guys that the ending wasn't even remotely satisfying. It was just sad. Stallone could have played this character with any other name and it wouldn't have changed the movie.

The tweenage girl's post-mortem descent was so fast that it wasn't rewarding or fun.Of course the new ending implies that the ghoulish trio (and cat) will just murder and bury new Gage in order to remake a happily now-undead family.

tt0837563,3,"The recent success of Stephen King adaptations must have inspired the creation of this film, I have not seen the 1989 version and I have only just now started reading the book, although I had knowledge of how the book ended. I was decently excited to see this film and it had some potential, but the final product is a serviceable but mediocre horror film that entertains but doesn't truly scare. The biggest issue with the movie is it's very hesitant to commit, the novel covers some very dark themes around the inevitability of death but the film only pokes the themes with a stick. Briefly introducing them in dialogue but not doing much else with them. The movie greatly suffers from being rushed, it never really takes its time to build up to characters or scares and just rushes its way from one plot point to another without giving any of them the time they need. What we end up with is a movie with decent acting, a few decent scares, a very messy third act and a stupid ending. Overall the film is mediocre but enjoyable, if you're a fan of the genre and just want a fun time at the movies it's worth a watch but it won't be one you remember, and it definitely doesn't live up to the legacy of the book.One other thing I'd like to touch on is the abysmal marketing, the second trailer has to be one of the worst movie trailers I've ever seen, the trailer touches on every major plotline in the movie and spoils basically everything but the ending, it even spoiled the one twist they changed from the book. If that wasn't bad enough they released a third trailer a week before the film came out, and the opening shot of the trailer had major spoilers for the movie. This kind of marketing has sadly become a common practice with a lot of films and it really needs to stop, a film sometimes gets upwards of 3 trailers before it releases, what's the point in seeing the movie if the trailer has all the best moments and ruins all the surprises?",Pet Sematary,2019-04-05,5.7,83030,2019
tt0837563,7,"Taking this film solely on adaptation bases and not comparing to the original film, this is an alright adaptation it has moments of tension, and good moments of horror in the first two acts. The acting is decent, and the final act really does pay off well, where you do really feel the tension suddenly building to a breaking point. I recommend people form their own view and watch this as more an adaptation than comparing with the original film.",Pet Sematary,2019-04-05,5.7,83030,2019
tt0837563,1,"I was excited for this remake the second I heard it was coming out! I figured with today's movie tech it could be more like the original story, even more so than the first 1989 movie. The story was changed so much to stand out as an artistic original for the directors, that it became a glorified zombie movie (eye roll). I read the book and watched the original movie, so I had high expectations for this to be even better than those! But it was a huge let down.
I hated the switch in characters, the daughter brought a whole new dynamic to the story and that alone changed the entire feeling for the movie in my opinion. Plus she was older so you're not as heart wrenched at the tragedy of her death, and I hated that when she came back she had memories of her life and just spoke in a lower voice to show her ""changed"" behaviour. I wasn't really a fan of her acting, had she played the Ellie from the original storyline, I think I would have liked her.
I also hated Jason Clark's portrayal of Louis Creed, he was kind of rude and standoff-ish and had zero emotion towards anything in this movie. The original Louis is loving, heartfelt, and affectionate. In this movie he just made you feel like he didn't care about anything. In the book and first movie Louis' grieving is so intense for his child after he dies that you're actually scared for why he's going to do. And when the child does come back; he comes back different. NOT zombie like but actually something worse. I was not impressed with the new version of the zombie being able to talk and converse with Louis and definitely thought the dancing and trashing the place was unnecessary and quite dumb.
And I hated Louis' relationship with Judd; he treats him like some kind of old relative you just want to die already. The original friendship is so much more, Judd shares way more info about the burial ground and gives more history to its powers and consequences. This movie left out a lot, and left a lot to be desired.
I also didn't like the role of Victor Pascal, he had a bigger part to play in the book and in this movie was just sort of thrown in to show they used a guy named Victor.
And lastly, the ending was absolutely TERRIBLE! It was literally just quick deaths, and then scene jumps to zombies standing around in dirty clothes. The girl trying to bury everyone to bring them back to life was ridiculous, it made zero sense and had nothing to do with the original story. I found this to be a cheap attempt for the directors to try and make it their own and add a twist, but it totally bombed and became just another zombie film like every other movie out there.
This story is terrifying, and meant to be sad enough to make you go crazy after being witness to the worst tragedy any parent could ever face. Crazy enough to want to dig up your dead child and bury them in an evil burial ground so that they could come back from death. And then being absolutely petrified with fear when the person you wanted back is no longer there and something else stands in its place.
Instead you get no character chemistry, changed plot and storyline, and a generic run-of-the-mill zombie wannabe movie.",Pet Sematary,2019-04-05,5.7,83030,2019

tt0837563,7,"A chilling supernatural thriller, Stephen King's Pet Semetary is adapted for the silver screen once again. When the Creed family moves into their new country home they discover a pet cemetery on the property, and unbeknownst to them there's an evil spirit in the woods that has designs on them. Jason Clarke leads the cast and gives a fairly solid performance. And the writers do an interesting job at making this adaption different than the 1989 version and at adding new elements. Also, the cinematography and set designs set a dark and foreboding mood. Yet the scares are rather tame, and the suspense is often undercut. Pet Semetary is creepy and is good for a few scares, but it's not as powerful or frightening as the original (or the book).",Pet Sematary,2019-04-05,5.7,83030,2019

Comparing the original story line, the movie did not change that much the course of events. However, they applied the classic old horror movie recipe - jump-scares and dramatic music (in scenes when it was clearly not the case) - and transformed the whole product into some cheap stuff.
The way the movie was filmed and put together as an artistic product makes me think of the Discovery TV shows that were showing reconstitutions of murders and strange events --> cheap and almost schematic.

I'm all for trying new things than the book, but other than the names, EVERYTHING is different. I'm shocked they cat wasn't made a dog.

tt0837563,5,"From the trailers, I was so excited to see this. I'm a huge fan of the novel, and whilst I'm well aware a certain amount of artistic licence goes into putting a book onto the big screen, they changed so much of the story that it was barely recognisable.
I understand why they changed which child was killed, you'd be hard pushed to find a toddler that can act as the living dead, but it didn't work with the older child either. In the book, the resurrected 'being' was taken over by a demon-in the film, Ellie is well aware she is dead, and she's living an unwanted 'afterlife' of which she is also aware, and it turns her evil.
There is no atmosphere in the film, the setting should be creepy and atmospheric, but I'll be honest, the scenes in the woods look very much like a stage set with dry ice covering the floor. It looks cheap and thrown together. The story is patchy and nonsensical in many places, it feels rushed to get to the end, and none of the characters are padded out enough for you to actually care about.
The one shining light in this is John Lithgow as Jud, he's incredibly well cast, but the let down with him is they didn't utilise him like they should have. One of my favourite parts of the novel is the friendship that develops between Louis and Jud, it's beautiful in places, and we learn a lot about Jud, his life, the burial ground, what becomes of anyone or anything that's buried there etc. But in the film he's just some old guy that pops up every now and then, with no real background-and there isn't a single whisper of the MicMacs and their part in the burial ground.
I also didn't like how in the film, they justified Rachel's irritating and bizarre neuroses about death by having her be responsible for her own sisters death, that was a completely new plot line addition for the purpose of the film
As for the ending, I'm not even sure I have it in me to comment, the ending turned it into a pseudo comical farce-the book left me feeling bleak and slightly bereft.

I went alone, because no one else was that jazzed to see it. Lucky them.It relies on predictable jump scares for the horror element. The gore was so-so.

tt0837563,1,"I just saw it and i hated it. Whenever it tried to do something different it did but for the worse.My biggest issues are :
We never saw Ellie really care about Church, so Jud suggesting to bury the cat in the Indian cemetery doesn't make sense. The parents taking Rachel and Gage doesnt make sense since we dont see the conflict between them, blaming Louis for the death of Gage. We never see Louis regret bringing Ellie back, where in the original one having Louis kill little Gage is as powerful as it can be, he has to take the life of his child with his own hands, and then just to see him commit the same mistake again with Rachel and ultimately paying with his life.
In this one what? their ultimate goal is to be ... a family of...zombies? huh? what?
Not to mention practical effects, make up on the teenager who got killed looked more like a mutant/burnt victim than an accident. Trailer crash was laughable, Ive seen youtubers pull better green screens than that. After Ellie has been killed by this huge truck all she has is.... a lazy eye? wtf... seriously?

tt0837563,1,"As a fan of the book and the original movie i wanted go into the movie with an open mind and to give it a chance, I knew within five minutes that this was going to be NOTHING like the book or the original movie. Although in some cases change can be a good thing sadly in this case it really wasn't! Where do I start? Jason Clarke and Amy seimetz had no on screen chemistry, they weren't convincing as a couple at all, I didn't have an emotional connection to the parents there was no warmth no real feeling of family, Gage was absent when Ellie wandered into the woods, with Louis at work had Rachel left him home alone? There was no building of friendship that grows between Louis and jud, it was like heres two men that have been neighbourly sure, but not even nearly close as they are in the book. My daughter has a cat, my neighbours are nice people , would they lead me to a magic place to bury it and bring it back from the dead ? No! That requires at minimum a huge amount of trust! A bond that wasn't there. No discussion about has anyone ever buried a person up there, no watching the children grow and flourish, that happiness and joy that seems perfect only to be ripped apart by the horror of the accident. No broken Rachel and Louis being overtaken by the power of the place unable to be there for his remaining family. No real background on Rachels parents and, the dislike they have of Louis or that he has for them, the hatred and horror that combusts at the funeral of the child. All these things that to me are key to building the bigger picture weren't there. They could have done amazing things with this movie, modernized it so its current but with the connection and the terror that is felt in the book and the first movie. All that and even paxcow as Ellie calls him didn't say what he was supposed to say, Zelda was really NOT scary, I thought they would make her equally if not more terrifying than original. and the end? Really??? Was this a remake? No, it was a different story that borrowed the original character names and the original title of a truly heart wrenching and horrific masterpiece and made into what felt like a cheap knock off.

The role of Pascow the ghost is pointless with his 3-5 minutes of screen time. The best part is John Lithgow only because he's John Lithgow. Ellie was good but scary...not so much. It's like they made a reboot of the 1989 version instead of writing a new script based on the book. The 1989 version at least creeped me out when I was a kid.

tt0837563,5,"Urg, it's only been however long but I'm already sick of hearing the praises of this stupid bland little movie! There's virtually nothing there, it's painfully average and half-assed as hell! Something that almost immediately bothered me about it was that everything in the first half felt horribly rushed and wafer thin, in terms of things like character development and motivations and characters that you actually cared about for that matter.. General buildup cohesion and emotional payoff of the story, pathos and all-important deeper dark themes of death grief horror and madness that the first movie integrated into the story and brought to the screen so well..this modern thing here to me doesn't come close to the original picture or book, oh no it does not! You know a lot of these reviews seem to me to consider this a better movie purely based on it being new, and that really makes me a little sad! Ok so I won't say that the acting was bad because it mostly wasn't, with the big exception for me being the distractingly Punch-like Jason Clarke, the guy is a horrible actor who has the emotional presence of a block and his interpretation of the Louis Creed character is just very off putting and not particularly even likeable at all.. In the vastly superior original, when Louis fails to save his little infant son in time from the truck on the pitch perfect sunny day that strangely made the event even more horrific? How he reacted, that scream? That was real mental anguish that you could feel and that hit you hard on display, this film had almost nothing to it in terms of emotional depth and grief you can feel, there wasn't any of the kind of all-consuming, maddening grief that would drive a father to dig up his own dead child to see here, he just did it without a second thought, there was no finesse or subtlety to it, the parents barely seem to grieve at all here, that felt rushed and tossed aside like everything else in order to get to the bloodshed, which by the way really wasn't anything to write home about.. On a positive it does have some solid performances, Jete Laurence was very impressive and she did her job perfectly, being sweet enough that you felt sad for her death and then effectively wicked and hateful enough that you were quite ready to see her die again! Very creepy moment with her and her dad when he's just cleaned her up after seeing her after her resurrection and he's lying next to her in bed and she speaks to him about what's in her head and where she's been after she died. I also thought it was a legit great moment when Rachel is nearly dead and the evil thing that was once her child is taunting her and she turns to her/it and says ""Don't call me mommy, you're not my daughter, Elle's dead..."" I loved that line, it really summed everything up and I could feel it because the damn movie actually slowed down for a moment and let me. Amy Seimetz I liked a lot too, she was really good and sympathetic. I love John Lithgow, he's always been nothing less than a class act as an actor...But he was no Jud Crandall. He did what he could with the role but he just immeasurably paled in comparison to the iconic performance of the late Fred Gwynne, that guy arguably MADE the original movie what it was, even I'll admit that. I didn't like the ending with the silly resurrected whole evil family all together and about to prey on poor little helpless Gage... That was just bonkers to me, what a trite and cheaply nasty way to end the movie. ""Beep beep!"" Nice. So it had potential and wasn't the worst remake that I've ever seen, but I'm not planning on seeing this again anytime soon, it was a weak movie that had no emotional or psychological weight to it, and even on it's own merit, Pet Sematary 2019 is nothing but another average horror remake that will never be as fondly thought of and remembered as the original classic still is thirty years on, and I suspect will in fact be largely forgotten soon enough.

He still has dozens of great books awaiting a movie adaptation, so why do we keep getting these second rate remakes of existing adaptations?I loved the 1989 original, it was an incredibly constructed genuinely great film so I was skeptical upon hearing about a remake. As usual, my fears were very justified.Starring the ultra bland Jason Clarke this goes down different roads than both the book and the original, it teases following the source material multiple times then suddenly goes in a different direction. I didn't appreciate this at all, throughout the entire film I was waiting for it give me a reason for it's existence. It never did.John Lithgow is a great actor and can consider me a fan, but for this role he's no Fred Gwynne. Fred Gwynne put in an iconic cult performance, Lithgow I'm sorry to say simply couldn't compare and his accent was terrible.The movie is another example of needless senseless remakes/reboots that simply aren't needed. There are countless tales just begging to get the big screen treatment, so why do we keep getting force fed the same ones?

tt0837563,3,"I have a fond memory of the 1st, but I've seen it recently and you can tell it has aged a bit. However, I saw the new one last night and I think they completely missed the mark. I appreciate a new storyline, but the characters have been completely stripped of any nuance, and the movie lacks a meaningful theme. The book and the original movie drew believable and flawed characters, which are now replaced by cardboard cutouts.
A few examples.
In the original, Judd shows Louis the burial ground as a warning. In one way or another Louis would have been drawn there, so he might as well learn that what comes back does not correspond to what gets buried there. Better having this insight with a cat, rather than with a person. A difficult and cynical call, which completely backfired. In the new version Judd simply did this so Ellie wouldn't be heartbroken....really makes for a compelling character.
In the original, Rachel is traumatized by Zelda's death because of her sense of guilt. Rachel felt a mixture of sorrow and disgust for Zelda, and wished for her to die. When this happened, she never got over her guilt for wishing for this, and probably felt responsible for her death. Zelda was a victim, and Rachel's visions are a manifestation of her guilt. In the new version, Zelda was jealous of Rachel's health, suggesting that she was malicious from the start. Sure, there is the incident with the lift... but the important bit, the fact that Rachel is conflicted and human, is pared back & dumbed down.
In the original, Louis's relationship with Rachel's family has always been tense. When Gage died, Rachel's parents blamed it all on Louis. This, on top of his own sense of guilt, ultimately drove him to bury his son... rationally knowing what to expect. On a similar note, Louis repeats the whole thing again when he buries his wife. He knows.... but keeps on lying to himself, because he's flawed - and human. In the new version, some of his bad choices are still there (actually only one), but the key element of him being delusional (because he's human and pushed beyond reason) is watered down, replaced by a character who is primarily a victim to circumstance.
So the theme of the original story, 'our weaknesses make us the architects of our own demise', is replaced by 's*** happens'. I've seen amazing horror movies in the past few years (Babadook, the vvitch, hereditary)... which prove you can make something that both entertains and provides meaningful subtext, if you're so inclined to digging a bit deeper. This clearly does not fall in that category.",Pet Sematary,2019-04-05,5.7,83030,2019

It's not about the Gorey details of his crimes, it's about Bundy's relationship with people and how manipulative he was.I am a true crime fan and have always considered myself ""too smart to fall for such evil"", but I have to admit, there were times when I found myself rooting for Ted Bundy and then realized what I was doing. If you let yourself be fully submerged in the movie and toss out any expectations and what you think you know about Ted Bundy, I think you will be pleasantly surprised at what you are able to feel about someone who was a living nightmare.

tt2481498,9,"""Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil, and Vile"" has been inspired by the atrocious murders committed by Ted Bundy. The director Joe Berlinger has chosen a different style to tell viewers the charismatic murderer's story. Maybe all the viewers may not like his style of storytelling, but I am one of those rare viewers who loved and enjoyed it.The main reason I enjoyed it so much is because the director has not followed the so-called norms and rules of a clichéd serial killer movie ; for instance, showing all the murders in slow-paced and full details, repetitively confirming the fact that a particular character is really a sociopath by presenting 8 or 9 scenes of him/her in fits of violent anger, and so on . Instead, Mr. Berlinger has decided to show us how intelligent, charismatic, innocent-looking, and convincing a serial killer can be in real life.The first half of the movie is conveyed through the perspective of Liz Kloepfer (Lily Collins), who was the girlfriend of Bundy. The second half is mostly based on the trials / courtroom sessions of Ted Bundy (played by Zac Efron). I would like to mention the fact that Zac Efron has given a brilliant, powerful, charming, and darkly captivating performance as the serial killer Ted Bundy.Zac Efron's performance is the greatest highlight of this movie. He presents the killer's intelligent act of playing innocent so brilliantly. Other outstanding performances are that of Lily Collins, who plays his longtime girlfriend Liz, and John Malkovich as the sharp-tongued judge. This is a performance-based movie, and if you want to see great performances by good actors, then watch this one and ignore the negative comments that some people will make about flaws with the story, screenplay, and other excusable and unnecessary mentions of minor errors here and there.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile",2019-05-03,6.6,80749,2019

Indeed, the film does not really deal with the police investigation and modestly eludes the macabre scenes of crimes, but, on the contrary, it highlights the duality of the monster: an odd mix of a successful womanizer and an accomplished serial killer, of Casanova and Jack the ripper, or an unexpected materialization of Harvey Dent, aka Two-Face, the fictional super-villain appearing in comic books published by DC, a criminal obsessed with duality and the conflict between good and evil.Thus, although Ted Bundy appears or seems 'lovable' in some of the first scenes, the movie depicts us, during the second half, a pathetic seducer of any individual within his tiny environment (the journalists, the jurors, the judge, the audience, ...), able to arrogantly smile like a politician during an election campaign, and devoid of any respect for the victims. This guy will literally sent chills up your spine. The film sadly ends with an exhaustive list of known victims, and as many bruised families.Great cast, especially Zac Efron unjustly cataloged with movies for decerebrated teenage girls, and excellently supported by Lily Collins, Kaya Scodelario, Angela Sarafyan. The atmosphere of the 70s is faithfully transcribed, with a neat photography. At last, it's quite unique to observe a serial killer through the eyes of a woman who truly loved him and was absolutely not aware of his dark side until the media coverage of the murders.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile",2019-05-03,6.6,80749,2019
tt2481498,8,People forget that Ted Bundy had a plea bargain for only life in prison with no death penalty. He refused it at the last minute which shocked the judge. I still like the 2002 Bundy film with Michael Reilly Burke who also did a great portrayal of Bundy. This is Zac's serious role for once and shows he is a great actor unlike some of his poor comedies.,"Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile",2019-05-03,6.6,80749,2019
tt2481498,10,"The point of the movie, which many seem to miss, is that you are supposed to be taken in by Ted Bundy's charm. It is showing you why so many fell victim to his charm. While watching, it is hard to belive that this is not an innocent man about to be convicted of terrible crimes. He is charming, has a long-term girlfriend (fiancé in the end) and a step-daughter. He lives a family life and shower them with affections. He is, on the surface, the perfect boyfriend.However, underneath one of the most wicked and evil serial killers of all time. He is merciless, cruel, and consistent in the type of victim he chooses. He is manipulating and intelligent, he is a human venus trap. The movie is trying to show how people rarely looks like monsters hiding in the dark. It could be anyone and only the occasional red flag appears. It makes you reevaluate human nature and the depth that could hide within a person.The performances in this movie are fabulous and it is a movie worth watching. Don't expect the usual serial killer type where you are led to realize what a terrible person they are through their crimes. It is a movie that makes you realize the terror of charming looks and intelligence coupled with a thirst for killing.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile",2019-05-03,6.6,80749,2019
tt2481498,6,"After seeing Joe Berlinger's incredible documentary and all the buzz around Zac Efron as Ted Bundy I was really excited to see this movie. I was hoping it would shed some more light on why Bundy did what he did and how he got away with it, as well as all this thing with girls being in love with him while he was on trial for murder.
After realizing the movie was based on Liz Kendall's book about her time with Bundy I expected the movie to focus on their relationship and how she found out that something was wrong. Also in the documentary it is stated that she found women's lingerie and other strange items in Bundy's appartment.
Instead, the movie sort of mixes both storylines. The crimes are only very briefly shown, the fact that he kept some of his victims heads and belongings isn't mentioned and it seems more about Bundy claiming his innocence. We all know he wasn't, so even though he did state he didn't do it, giving it so much time in the movie seems wrong.
Overall this movie left me pretty unsatisfied. The casting of the movie is really good, I already knew Zac Efron could be Bundy's long lost Son or something, the resemblance is kind of scary, the costume design department, locations and camera work are very good, it is just the script and storytelling that really put me off.
If you want to enjoy Zac Efron in seventies clothing though, go watch.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile",2019-05-03,6.6,80749,2019
tt2481498,5,"First the good. Solid work from the actors, particularly Efron, Parsons and Milkovich. The costuming and set design was spot on, especially the Miami court room.Now the not so good, there is just too much to unpack with Ted Bundy to cover in 110 minutes. The movie has to gloss over so much material to fit time constraints. We only mildly see Bundy's manipulative skills. We never see the psychopathy. Without more detail and more insight into the crimes, the movie is really just flabby and flaccid.To me, this movie would have been better served as a mini series so we could see the beginnings and evolution of Bundy and his relationships.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile",2019-05-03,6.6,80749,2019
tt2481498,6,"Directed by Joe Berlinger immediately after completing work on Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes (2019), Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile is worth seeing for Zac Efron's performance, but is a strangely muted affair, neither ghoulish warts-and-all carnage nor restrained psychological treatise. Telling the story of Ted Bundy from the perspective of a woman who was oblivious to his true nature is an interesting narrative choice, and had Berlinger stuck to this format, it could have made for a fascinating film. However, the longer it goes on, the more it seems to revel in Bundy's flamboyance, and what begins as an intriguing insider's look at living with a killer soon shifts into an underwhelming courtroom drama, only returning to its original tone in the final (fictional) scene.The film begins in 1969, the night Bundy (Efron) and nm10616856 (Lily Collins) first met in a Seattle bar. As a single mother with a low-paying job, she is surprised to find this charismatic, handsome, and intelligent law student so interested in her, but interested he is, with the duo quickly falling in love. However, six years later, when he is stopped in Utah for a minor traffic violation, the police find ropes, handcuffs, ski mask, leather gloves, and a crowbar in his car, and he is subsequently charged with and convicted of attempted kidnapping. He vehemently protests his innocence to Liz, and although concerned, she accepts his explanations. However, as police departments across California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Utah, Colorado, and Florida start to connect him to a string of recent murders, it becomes harder and harder for Liz to deny there's more to her boyfriend than she ever imagined.Very loosely based on Liz Kloepfer's memoir, The Phantom Prince: My Life With Ted Bundy (1981), Extremely Wicked was written by Michael Werwie. The hook for the original script was that the audience is unaware the character is Bundy; the film was written as a supposedly fictional story of a young couple whose life is shattered when he is accused of multiple murders, with his real identity only coming as a final act twist. As Berlinger was completing The Ted Bundy Tapes, the script was offered to him, and although he found the twist distasteful, he loved the idea of looking at the Bundy story through the eyes of someone who thought him to be innocent.One of the biggest appeals of the movie, of course, is the unexpected casting of Zac Efron as Bundy (Efron also serves as executive producer). And it has to be said, he's excellent. Although he doesn't really look like Bundy, he has the mannerisms down to a tee. Especially if you watch the film after the docu-series, you'll really pick up on the depth of the performance; Efron's every movement and gesture, the way he smiles, the way he stands, the tone of his voice, everything is perfect. Of course, Bundy's good looks and charisma were his most formidable weapons as he proved that evil could fester under an attractive façade, and this gives Efron room to manoeuvre, playing every scene in such a way that the subtext is always apparent, although never allowing Bundy's mask to slip. Indeed, it's the absence of any obvious monstrousness in the performance which is so unnerving.One of the film's most notable components is that, apart from one brief scene near the end, there is no depiction of violence. As Liz's story, the idea is to present Bundy not with the 20/20 hindsight of history, but with the same degree of ambiguity with which she would have viewed him. It's an interesting way into the story and seems a genuine attempt to do something more than simply reproduce the salacious details of the crimes. Of course, if you're making a film about a serial killer which doesn't feature much in the way of serial killing, you're going to need to fill it with something, and in this sense, Berlinger focuses, at least in the first half, on how a killer can lie and manipulate, coming across as completely normal to all who know him. Berlinger has said that the film is about the mechanics of how a person can be ""seduced by someone capable of evil"", and it was his intention that the audience actually like Bundy, as he wanted them to feel disgust with themselves - just like Liz, he wanted them to be seduced by evil.However, as admirable as this approach is, the film has a lot of problems. For one thing, because it depicts Bundy not as we now know him but as his contemporaries saw him, it means we only see the performative side, never the monstrous underbelly. Sure, this means that the film avoids exploitation, but in doing so, it could be accused of sanitisation (to be fair, this is something of a damned if you do, damned if you don't scenario - show the murders and you're exploiting real-life suffering, don't show them and you're hiding the true nature of his crimes). And granted, portraying him as a possibly innocent man is part of the attempt to explain how Liz could be duped, but all the good intentions in the world don't change the fact that the film's Bundy is a lovable rogue who bites his thumb at the system, not a murderer, a man who raped and butchered a 12-year-old child, and who decapitated multiple women and had sex with their corpses.I understand that Berlinger wants to depict how Liz could have been blinded by devotion to a man that she thought (correctly, as it turned out) was too good to be true. But the problem is that she herself is never characterised enough for this to work; everything we learn about her is predicated on her relationship with him - there's nothing about her life prior to meeting him, and what we learn about her life after he was convicted is primarily fictional. Additionally, the focus shift halfway through as the film transitions from Liz as subjective focaliser to a more objectively focalised courtroom drama makes very little tonal sense. It's almost as if Berlinger loses interest in Liz when the sensationalist trial begins. This transition reduces Liz to a cycle of watching the trial, crying, doubting his guilt, drinking, watching the trial, crying etc, as she's effectively stripped of what little agency she had in the first half.Another problem is that we learn nothing new about Bundy himself; there's nothing about his childhood, for example, or how he got away with the murders for so long, whether he really loved Liz, or if he genuinely lacked the ability to feel empathy. Along the same lines, we learn nothing whatsoever about the victims. This was also a problem in the docu-series, but it's far more pronounced here, and because of this, the decision to put the names of his known victims on screen at the end of film is unearned, crass, and meaningless.The film also makes some strange changes to documented fact, many of which seem designed to make Bundy more sympathetic. For example, there's no mention of the fact that he tried multiple times to pressure Liz into rough sex, particularly choking. Another scene sees him forcibly restrained in his cell whilst a dentist takes impressions of his teeth. In reality, the impressions were taken in a dentist chair, and Bundy quite happily allowed the dentist to work. The film also shows him continuing to try to contact Liz throughout his incarceration. In reality, however, he lost contact with her in the early 80s, and there's no evidence he tried to find her.Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile is by no means a bad film. But it could have been so much better. The shift from subjective focalisation to court-room drama makes very little sense, and fundamentally undermines what Berlinger seems to have been trying to do. The film initially looks at how evil can hide in plain view, creeping into our lives under the guise of normalcy, but Berlinger allows this theme to recede into the background as he hands the narrative over to Bundy. If this was supposed to be Liz's story, Berlinger takes his eye off the ball badly. And although the film certainly doesn't sympathise with Bundy, and although the decision not to show any of the murders is commendable, the fact is that, yet again, Ted Bundy has become very much the star of his own show.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile",2019-05-03,6.6,80749,2019
tt2481498,5,"This movie had such potential, but failed to fulfill any of it.
It's a real shame because the costumes, sets and locations were all fantastic. It was shot nicely. The soundtrack was okay, but could've been better I guess. The acting was great. I think given better material Zac Efron could've done great things with this role. He certainly looked the part and he did well with what he had; the problem is he didn't have a whole lot to work with.
I think the main issue is it lacked a clear focus. Whose story was it? It wasn't Liz's, it wasn't Bundy's, it wasn't Carol Anne's, it wasn't even any of the victim's stories. It just waffled on showing a few of the moments/facts we already knew.
If you're going to give a movie a ridiculously long title like ""Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil, and Vile"" then you kind of need to show some wicked, evil, and vile acts at some point in the movie. Okay, so I get that it's not considered acceptable to glorify the crimes of serial killers. I agree with this, but you certainly shouldn't try to make the audience sympathise with them while barely mentioning their numerous victims and the families of those victims. That list of names slapped on the end just before the credits made me cringe. Was that all the recognition these innocent victims deserved?
For me, the disappointment comes down to the fact that this movie was about one of the most prolific killers of all time and his crimes weren't depicted at all, nor were the stories of his victims. If you watched this movie, not knowing anything about Bundy, you certainly wouldn't leave it thinking about just how terrible his ""extremely wicked, shockingly evil, and vile"" acts were. You wouldn't feel the immense loss he caused. I'm really not sure what you'd take away from it. Maybe you just be confused as I was.
Very poorly executed which I guess comes down to a poor screenplay.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile",2019-05-03,6.6,80749,2019
tt2481498,6,"The movie is extremely disjointed and seems to be a series of set pieces versus a coherent story line where we slowly realize the depth of Bundy's depravity. Yes, we know in real life Bundy was a charming psychopath but it would have been more enjoyable to watch him slowly unveil himself as the monster he was. We know pretty much at the outset that he is a 2-faced psycho with cops and detectives hot on his trail from the first sequence. The cinematography and sets capture the look of the 70s but the pace is too frenetic with too many jump cuts and pseudo cinéma vérité camera work. The entire atmosphere is strangely cheery with upbeat 70s pop music in light of the dark and heavy material. Bundy's ability to charm his actual victims isn't really given much exposure versus his immediate family and the legal system which he manipulated. Zac Efron, who bears more than a passing resemblance to Bundy, gives a decent performance and was a good casting choice. The courtroom scenes that make up the third act are where the film finally finds it's feet. If you are familiar with the actual case, you may be disappointed with how the plot unfolds. If not, you should come away with a better understanding of the case but with little knowledge of his many victims. Recommended with these caveats.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile",2019-05-03,6.6,80749,2019
tt2481498,9,"Throughout the film, Zac Efron's performance as Ted Bundy being cool, calm, collected and charming was spectacular. His overall performance was chilling as he provokes you to feel as though he is innocent. This movie is a look at how serial killer movies should be done. They aren't just crazies out on the street, they're your coworkers, your friends, your family. Sit back and contemplate every relationship you've had as you watch a captivating narrative on Ted Bundy's trial and later life.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile",2019-05-03,6.6,80749,2019
tt2481498,8,"Okay, i've read a lot of the reviews here, and some seem to be forgetting the fundamental point.
Someone said they saw him in a different light? Like he was a person capable of love?
NO!
You saw him in the light HE CONVEYED to others. That was the point. It's teaching you to look out for the little things, because some people are so good at hiding who they truly are. All throughout, there were red flags she ignored.
Someone else made a valid point, that the perspective of law enforcement isn't recognised in the cases of these people. And I agree. No one ever stops to consider how it would impact the lives of the ones forced to deal with them.
The ones who were annoyed that the murders weren't shown? Grow up.
It's a true story. Which means the murders stemmed from his psyche. The more you know about their behaviour, the better chance of recognising it in your own life BEFORE a murder occurs, and thus avoiding a horrible death. Analyse the situation from different perspectives, and you gain a greater understanding in to the way these people operate. To better protect yourselves and the people around you.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile",2019-05-03,6.6,80749,2019
tt2481498,4,"I understand the directors choice to reflect more on Ted Bundy's personality such as his ability to be charismatic and manipulative. I actually appreciate that the focus wasn't on showing the mere brutality that occurred with each of his murders. With that being said I didn't feel like I was watching a movie about a serial killer. It seemed like I was watching a movie about a man who was wrongfully convicted and under the thumb of authorities. I know he made claims to being framed, but I felt the film tried to make you think there was potential for it to be true. If I hadn't already known much about the history and crimes of Bundy I would of considered the possibility that it he was being framed might have occurred. All other aspects of the movie were great, acting, set, costumes were all satisfactory.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile",2019-05-03,6.6,80749,2019
tt2481498,10,This was a fantastic movie. Zac Efron did an amazing job with the same facial expression and charisma as Bundy had. They didnt go into much depth on the brutality of the murders which I really appreciate. It was more about the emotional damage put on Liz and her perspective of it all. This movie is amazing,"Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile",2019-05-03,6.6,80749,2019
tt2481498,5,"I expected this movie to be a little darker and a little bit more psychologically disturbing. As someone who watches and reads a lot of true crime documentaries and books based around serial killers, I wanted this movie to show me something I didn't already know.I, however found myself actually liking the 'character' of Bundy. They portrayed the charming and funny side of him, the side which made women swoon and young ladies want to sleep with him. I wanted to hate him and to sympathise with his victims however the movie did nothing to make that happen.I can imagine that for someone who hasn't heard of Bundy before, to watch this movie wouldn't exactly understand why he was one of the most prolific serial killers of all time. They would just see a charming and seemingly innocent man.I wish this movie had paid more tribute to his victims and made the film a lot darker in order to match the name they chose for the title. I feel had it focused more around his crimes and the way he evaded justice for so long then this movie would be perfectly titled.
It lacks in any new information, doesn't give an insight into why he did what he did nor does it shock you.Overall I did enjoy the movie, just not in the way I expected to.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile",2019-05-03,6.6,80749,2019
tt2481498,5,"It was shame that the movie focused on the trial part and on that particular single mother only. This movie could've been something more thrilling and disturbingly eye catching at the same time, as in good crime movie, but instead they chose safe and mediocre path. To be frank the trial part wasn't even that good either.
It appears this movie is just about mimicking the actual people who were involved in that moment. Which means it didn't have to be a movie. Documentary version would've been much better. When movie loses to documentary, it simply means it was boring.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile",2019-05-03,6.6,80749,2019
tt2481498,4,"Ted would have loved this movie. Once again, he is the star and center of attention. Not only is Ted played by heartthrob Zac Efron, but he also gets almost two hours of screen time to manipulate us so we feel sorry for him. What more could a sociopath ask for?Meanwhile, the women that he murdered are treated as a simple plot device. We learn nothing about who they were, and what they might have become. Their names are on screen for 30 seconds at the end of the movie. A token gesture, after their deaths have been exploited and their killer humanized.Ted was extremely wicked, but you would never know it by the sympathetic, charming, and tragic portrayal he receives in this movie. Go read the actual details about his crimes, and you will agree he was pure evil and better off forgotten.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile",2019-05-03,6.6,80749,2019

tt2481498,6,"As many others have stated, this isn't a film about Ted Bundy on one of his murdering sprees. This is about Bundy himself and how he made his way in the world. Someone said at one point they found themselves rooting for him. I never did, but that's because at my age, it's hard to fool me after all the phonies I've met.Some people will be disappointed because we didn't get to see all the horror he visited on women, but it was a refreshing change of emphasis here.To see the young women salivating over him in the courtroom, cheering him on, was both shocking and expected. Real footage was used. I remember women doing that over the Menendez brothers. Part of it is the old takeoff on a Geraldo Show - ""Men in Prison and the Women Who Love Them,"" a phenomenon that happens time and time again. With Bundy, because he was particularly good-looking, it was an even stronger reaction.Zac Efron is a favorite of mine -he resembles my favorite classic film star, Tyrone Power, and I thought he captured the charm and personality of a whack job really well. Lily Collins is terrific as his girlfriend. Both of these actors are growing into exceptional performers.In the end ""Extremely Wicked"" makes a sad statement. Good looks. confidence, and charm will bring you a long way in this world. We've seen it too often. It's time to start looking at people's souls. The external is, after all, only that.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile",2019-05-03,6.6,80749,2019
tt2481498,9,"I Think that this movie really captures the reality of how charming ted bundy was. It does this through the idea of the viewer (us) kind of teams up with Ted Bundy and taking his side, with us Well aware knowing that he did these horrible crimes.Very good movie about a horrible man.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile",2019-05-03,6.6,80749,2019
tt2481498,6,"Hmm. This movie was not what I expected. Nothing was developed and it was more a series of events which focused on the love story. It didn't show Ted's evil side until one scene about the hacksaw. I can understand the writer's point of view of wanting to do this affect to show what a liar he was, and him not admitting until the end that he was guilty. I was disappointed it didn't show his relationship with any of his victims or how he killed them, it just showed photos in a court case. I think if it portrayed more of what happened to the victims and how he did it, it would depict his double life and be more shocking to watch. Overall I wasn't gripped in the story and think it could have focused on certain scenes more instead of jumping from scene to scene. This man was evil and the movie should portray how evil he was.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile",2019-05-03,6.6,80749,2019
tt2481498,5,"The story of Ted Bundy is so complex and interesting (pardon me, I know the crimes were heinous) that it's a shame this movie is what they did with it. They tried to cram all of these decades long events into a little less than 2 hrs. What is the result - a fragmented view on of one of the worst serial killers and psychopaths in the recent history. The movie is all over the place; I don't know if they wanted the focus to be on the girlfriend, on the murders, on his psychopathy, or on the trial. That's because they had no focus. This is one lousy movie from beginning to end, storytelling-wise.I always hate it when they make crappy movies out of true events which were documented in detail both in video and in writing. And Zac did a really good job in portraying him and would have done an even better job if the script was better.
Their resemblance is uncanny.This should have been a miniseries. You can't cram 30 years of someone's complicated personal and criminal life into 2 hrs and expect a well-rounded, fulfilling story.Very disappointing.","Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile",2019-05-03,6.6,80749,2019
tt2481498,10,"First off, even I was worried that I wouldn't be able to see Zac Efron as anything else but Troy Bolton running around trying to be a serial killer, I was so happy to be proven wrong. Zac was brilliant in this part, very convincing!Without giving away the movie, I'm sad that so many missed the point and gave it such a low rating because they expected more gore. First off, this is based of a true story, with families still suffering from what Ted did to their beloved ones. I think that putting Liz perspective as the main story was a great choice because Ted wasn't the type that anyone would suspect due to his charms and manipulation. Imagine spending years of your life with someone this vile and everything you know about him is the opposite. I'm glad they chose to share Liz's side of the story.Other than that the movie was everything I wanted it to be. Actors where beautifully casted, the resemblance is sometimes scary on point. The costumes and settings were great, I was never bored even though it wasn't much action or gore.Only thing I could complain about is questionable camerawork at some scenes, (especially the scene where Ted and Carole Ann talks and the camera moves around them in an unsteady manor) but it's not enough to lower the over all score!

tt7752126,6,"This felt like a stripped down, summarized version of this story. No time is really invested into characters, so you don't really feel anything for them. The concept, while fascinating, is never fully explored. The actors all do their best though and are solid throughout. The film is also surprisingly gore-filled and there were some genuinely queasy moments. Everything just chugs along at a breakneck pace and it plays out as you'd expect. There was an opportunity to take a lot of chances with this story, but it decides to settle for being a mildly entertaining flick.",Brightburn,2019-05-24,6.1,80727,2019
tt7752126,4,"This film pitched a very simple question - 'What if Superman was evil?'. After watching it, I feel like this was a marketing ploy used to sell the script and bring audiences to the door. Honestly, if you take the Superman aspect out of it, this is really just your generic low-budget horror flick. The gist of it is a kid wants to be evil one day and just goes ahead killing people. That's really it.This is one of those rare stories,that I feel could really benefit from an additional 30 minutes. The fact that the runtime is limited to 90 minutes, results in a lot of rushed scenes, which are consequenced by my biggest complaint, the editing. It feels like they shot all the scenes individually,but had no idea how to transition, so they stitched them together. You're just bouncing from scene-to-scene-to-scene and it's incredibly jarring. There are several moments when I thought, yes, this is interesting,but please slow down so I can marinate in it. Nope,next scene.There are,however, a few redeeming aspects. The actors do a really good job, and I really wish they had more time to sell us on the material. The gore,is actually quite good; there are some really brutal, bloody moments that I enjoyed. And finally, the creative decision to add Billie Eillish' 'bad guy' was genius.Overall,I don't really know what you're looking for in this story. If it's a dark Superman twist, you won't get it. If it's horror, it's mediocre. As a slasher gore film, not bad at all. I'd classify this as wasted potential.",Brightburn,2019-05-24,6.1,80727,2019

What if Superman became evil is what I would sum up Brightburn in a nutshell. And it does have an interesting concept, it's just poorly executed. This is produced by James Gunn, the same man who gave us two Guardians of the Galaxy. And what I think is that James Gunn had this interesting concept for this character and all the pieces were there. But instead of coming up with an intellectual script, the script writers took the pieces, threw it into the trash, and turned it into a generic horror film. It's as if almost everyone took a different approach, and decided to turn this concept to what if Superman was evil? to What if Jason Vorhees or Michael Meyers had superpowers? But even Jackson A. Dunn who plays Brandon Beyer has zero character development and is annoying from start to finish. There's no character development anywhere. No questions as too where he came from? Who are his parents? How'd he get his superpowers? There's no explanation. They just turn him into a psychopath and he starts killing innocent people who didn't deserve to die just because he didn't get his way.

But, WAY too much time is spent on the build up and there is very little done in coming up with a solution to the problem. Most of the movie is spent on exposition.What could have been done is that he started his killing spree earlier on, was discovered, and somehow, a solution was formed or attempts at a solution were implemented. There was no foil to evil 'super-kid'. All it ended up being was a big exposition and then the typical late-into-the-movie mounting body count.The movie feels incomplete - like half a movie.",Brightburn,2019-05-24,6.1,80727,2019
tt7752126,1,"This pathetic movie bills itself as ""Superman gone Bad."" And when I heard that tagline I was intrigued enough to buy a ticket - something I now regret.
Because this isn't a bad Superman - it's just a bad movie.Here's the entire plot: A mindless orgy of hyperviolence and grisly murder by an alien child with superpowers. That's it. You now know the entire movie.There is no backstory, no explanation for the child's homicidal mania. He's just a crazy superpowered murder-machine. The director has no need for story. Instead, he's content to maximize blood & gore - taking great pleasure in depicting each murder with excessive detail. Amplified sounds of crushing bones, bodies suddenly blasted to pieces, close up shots of glass chunks jamming into eyeballs, death-ray vision blowing holes in people's heads.My advice is to skip this movie entirely and instead watch the terrific 1956 film ""The Bad Seed."" It's also about a murderous child, but is told skillfully and persuasively - and was nominated for 4 Academy Awards. You might also check out Episode 73 of ""The Twilight Zone"" (1961). Titled ""It's a Good Life,"" it is a compelling glimpse into the mind of an impulsive 6-year-old child with deadly superpowers. It stars Billy Mumy as the awful child, and Cloris Leachman & John Larch as his very frightened parents. Unfortunately the director of ""Brightburn"" never saw either of these two excellent productions - because if he had, he would have quickly realized he needed to include a story . . . .",Brightburn,2019-05-24,6.1,80727,2019

I was hoping for something new and fresh in an area flooded with do-gooders and the upright. Thankfully this movie delivers on this and more. The premise of this film is not one we have seen before in the ""superhero"" genre. What would the world do if a super-powered life form came to Earth and realized that we were all just insects to it? It starts out very ""Clark Kent"" like with the couple who have no children happening upon a child falling from the heavens. The parents see this as a blessing. As if the universe heard their cries for a child and answered them. Soon though, this Smallville scene takes a turn towards absolute terror. This ""child"" isn't what he seems to be. He isn't a boy, or a human. He's something altogether different. I was very pleased at the difference in the normal storytelling we see from Hollywood.

The kid is Superman as a villain. That's an interesting and cool idea.
It's a sci-fi in first place. It was fine anyway. It had it's moments, it does something that you don't see often in movies and I think it works out great, even tho you wouldn't expect it. But as the title says, it is a one timer.Beside the good things in the movie, there are bad things also.The story did not include parts that we should have seen.
We don't get to see what's happening inside the head of the boy. Almost at all!

Hopefully there may be other films which will try to explore the dark side of Superhero genre successfully, like Joker did.",Brightburn,2019-05-24,6.1,80727,2019
tt7752126,4,"Whether you like Zack Snyder's controversial, grittier take on Superman in ""Man Of Steel"" or felt that it was a complete butchery of the character, I assure you that whatever was done in this film makes what Snyder did look great. ""Brightburn"" tells a 'what if' tale about an evil Superman, or in this case, Superboy. It is a horror take on the classic mythos with Superman now being a 12-year-old boy who turns out to be evil.On paper, that sounds amazing. A deconstruction of the iconic character that has actually worked surprisingly well in it's original medium- the comics. Furthermore, it is produced by James Gunn and written by his brothers, Brian and Mark. With Gunn being so closely attached to this project, how could it possibly fail? After all this is James Gunn we are talking about, the man who is responsible for bringing the d-list ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" to the big screen. Gunn's 2010 film, ""Super"" was also a deconstruction of the superhero genre by itself and ""Slither"" was an excellent homage to old school horror films. Looking back at his past filmography, ""Brightburn"" seems to be a sure fire culmination of them all. Unfortunately, this is not directed nor written by him.As mentioned, the script was written by his brothers, who previously worked on ""Journey 2"", the one with The Rock. Director David Yarovesky who has done nothing really notable, other than a music video for ""Guardians of the Galaxy 2"" and some horror feature no one's heard before, helms this. Boy, does it really show. For a film that aims to subvert the superhero genre or the mythos, it does nothing new. Instead, the end product is bleak and dire that even out matches the dark DC Snyder-verse, in that area. However, it is also bland and dull.For some reason, this film has no comedic elements or even fun at all. Although I appreciate it being in full horror territory, the lack of James Gunn's signature tongue in cheek tone is infuriating. It's as if ""Brightburn"" tries so hard to make fun of and criticize ""Man of Steel"" but becomes the worse version of it. There are so many elements that Yarovesky and his writers directly lift from ""Man of Steel"". Heck, even the score sounds similar to Hans Zimmer's epic. However, all these elements felt watered down and it is not way as glorious as it's predecessor.""Brightburn"" feels unusually cheap and I don't mean as a low budget film only. The script is weak and the narrative feels incomplete. Scenes felt like they have not enough shot coverage or footage available. The entire film feels too rushed as a whole. I can't believe that I missed the slower pace of ""Man of Steel"". There are also weird character decisions that don't make any sense and only seemed to be made for moving on the plot.Despite the acting being mostly competent, I could not care less about the characters. There is zero character development whatsoever, especially for the evil kid and weirdly enough, there is also no mythology fleshed out at all which leaves a ton of unanswered questions by the end. Additionally, ""Brightburn"" suffers from most of the same pitfalls of being formulaic and generic as any other modern day horror film. There is an over-reliance on jump scares and cut away from as much from the gore as possible.Overall, it is really maddening how the film never reached a bit of it's creative potential. What we have got is a bare minimum of a movie that is so subpar to even call it a deconstruction of anything. It should have been over the top, satirical or at least scary. It's funny as an over the top character, played by one of James Gunn's commonly worked with actors, showed up when the credits rolled, leaving you to realise this should have been the tone of the film.For a better deconstruction of the genre, audiences might want to watch Josh Trank's ""Chronicle"" instead. Despite my hatred of found footage, I appreciate what Trank was trying to do and it is a proper way to look at the genre differently. Or audiences can just go and watch ""Man of Steel"" again as flawed as it maybe; Snyder did fleshed out a unique perspective of the character. This on the other hand, is I quote from another reviewer, a cheap one-night-stand that takes all your money and leaves you unsatisfied.",Brightburn,2019-05-24,6.1,80727,2019
tt7752126,7,"The film is strangely similar to Superman, Brandon Breyer having many similarities with Clark Kent: a staggering arrival on earth of an alien with a human appearance within a kind of meteorite, a secret adoption by a couple in the countryside, the famous red cape (obviously!) and a metal from the meteorite that seems to be the equivalent of kryptonite. But, if Clark strives to 'protect' the world, Brandon should all just 'take' the world!As a synthesis: 6.4 of 10 on IMDb? Clearly underrated!

tt7752126,7,"Sometimes we watch a film that does not end the way we want (or expect). ""Brightburn"" is one of those films.

However when adolescence comes, the powerful boy turns into an evil creature instead of a conventional hero. And from this moment on, he becomes a cruel being incapable to be destroyed and the film has a bleak, pessimist and unpleasant conclusion. Is ""Brightburn"" a bad movie? No, but probably will not please many viewers. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Brightburn - Filho das Trevas"" (""Brightburn - Son of the Shadows"")",Brightburn,2019-05-24,6.1,80727,2019

I am a big fan of Superman and seeing how this movie was based on that alien kid with superpowers basically being a God among men Superman trope, needless to say, I was pretty excited. It was also interesting how this movie took that concept and tried to make it into a horror/monster movie. But if you forget the cool concept and the gimmick, the movie is bad. It's just bad and so very boring. It's not even a good horror movie. One of the major issues I had with this movie was the decision of the writers to make the alien boy act, not on his own will but as something that just doesn't have a mind of its own and is just sent to Earth to take over the planet. I know it's the writers' decision but I thought it would have been more interesting if the kid acted on his own will and did bad things just because he could without any repercussions. Any kid who would have such powers would do whatever he wants and some of the things he may want may not be innocent but be very cruel. The decision to make him a mindless killing machine didn't work for me. They made him just another generic monster. And as a horror/monster movie, the film just doesn't work. Even the modern horror movies are trying so hard to stand out by not falling into cliches and the overused horror tropes. But this movie didn't make any such effort. I was really bored most of the time. The acting sucks. Writing sucks. There are some cool moments but I wouldn't watch this movie again. 3/10",Brightburn,2019-05-24,6.1,80727,2019

It was off to a quick start, but sadly. That isn't always a good thing. There are seemingly no segway between scenes in the opening act, all the scenes just seem random and pieced together. I'm not sure if there were scenes that got cut or what, but there's practically no depth. The lack of depth extends from the scenes to the characters. I don't ever see the motive behind his anger. He's just a psychopath kid that wants to kill anyone that tells him no ""yawn"". This movie is incredibly boring and for a 7 million dollar budget, it really should not be this way.For a movie that sells itself as ""if Superman wasn't a good guy"" there's also literally no buildup to the kid being normal to figuring out his abilities. He puts his hand in a lawnmower and next thing you know he's using his laser vision to slice through doors. I guess invulnerability and laser vision go hand in hand? I'm not saying he's kryptonian, but I can't imagine these are the kinda things one would pick up overnight, the kid didn't exactly sell himself as a genius.His parents act completely clueless halfway through the movie. Talking about him when he's literally in the next room (guess he doesn't have super hearing, how convenient). Still pretending he's a child when they've seen the things he can do.It's like they wrote this movie to suit a bad plot and not minds or hearts.

tt2274648,2,"Watching this, it feels like a twelve-year-old wrote the screenplay by tacking together scenes that might look cool without giving any thought to what the dialog would sound like when spoken out loud by human beings. Ian McShane does his best to sound convincing, while some of the other actors don't seem to see the point in even doing that and it's hard to blame them. There are plot holes throughout and segments that make little-to-no sense and add nothing to the story, although would maybe look neat if the effects were any good. The whole thing generally feels like someone slapped together at least four or five stories and tried to turn them into a coherent whole, which wouldn't surprise me, although I don't know enough about the comics to say for certain.I'm not sure where to place the blame for the awful pacing, but the movie is just unrelenting. There are times when things should wind down, but then it's just more noisy stuff happening. For example, at one point a character is in need of specialized medical attention and they find out it'll be a fairly-long and ""treacherous"" trek to get it. The character is then cured within 1-2 minutes of runtime, the trek portion being a few seconds of that, then we jump straight into some exposition, then we jump straight back to what we were doing before, presumably after a long and treacherous trek back that also happens instantaneously. To get an idea of how jarring this feels, imagine if Gandalf told Frodo about what it would take to destroy the ring and the next scene was at Mount Doom.The direction is mostly just odd, and I have no idea if it's because the director couldn't figure out what was happening in the script or because someone was meddling with his work.Finally, the CGI monsters look terrible.

The soundtrack consists of some out of place rock songs that are stuck in random places in the film. Unlike Del Toro's films, there is no way of feeling any sympathy for the one-dimensional characters. The endless stream of silly one-liners and aimless quips make you realize that these annoyingly unpleasant characters have nothing to tell us over the course of two (!) excruciating hours. The movie simply jumps from exposition piece to action scene and back again. And where Guillermo Del Toro created a tactile world with a balanced combination of practical effects work and sparingly used CGI, we are now saddled with special effects that look like the deleted scenes from a Playstation 3 game.

The movie is way more faithful to the comics but it also tries to be faithful to the previous movies (which every reboot should try to be) but it just becomes a mess of attempts.
The CGI is overused- WHEN WILL STUDIOS LEARN!- and although the creatures design is very interesting, pretty much every character lacks the dept the old duology provided.
At the end of the day Hellboy(2019) is just another failed reboot that tries to be it's own thing while respecting the previous movies.
My rating?
5 out of 10, but I do agree with the 61% rating on rotten tomatoes because the movie isn't all crap, there's a charm to it but it's not enough to make you overlook it's flaws.
Just watch the Guillermo del Toro duology, it's a far superior franchise, and I would of loved to see the third movie if the studios didn't cancelled it.
If you are interested in the director Neill Marshall (which despite the failed attempt of rebooting Hellboy is a damn good director) go watch Dog Soldiers which is criminally underrated.

Directed by Neil Marshal, who has worked on Game of thrones and West World, this is not the Neil Marshall who gave us the horror masterpiece that is The Decent.
This is the Neil Marshal who gave us Dog Soldiers and Doomsday.
Silly, gory, surprising and does not give a **** about embracing it absurd concept to the full. David Harbor knocks it out of the park as Hellboy, and one thing he has over Ron Perlman's performance is a sense of threat; that he really could be evil of pushed too far.
The whole film moves at a fast pace and has a feel of a video game, but here it works, with a mix of Devil May Cry and God of War, especially in the combat and design of some creatures.

The writing is bad and feels like a Jr. High boy's creative writing assignment, full of fantastic concepts that have all been done before. There's a lot of explaining about past events and scene setup that should come from situations and dialog, but instead is given to us in a ""Oh yeah, forgot to tell you..."" fashion.

Makeup design on the various supernatural characters left a lot to be desired.
I feel in trying to separate themselves from being compared to Guillermo Del Toro's Hellboy movies, the creators took away anything that could have made this movie good.

This is a very different take on these iconic characters and the world they inhabit and it is the most fun version that I've seen so far. Don't get me wrong, I loved GDT's films, the man crafts beautiful modern fairly tales and this film was smart no to try and replicate that. Instead, this movie has more in common with #SamRaimi's #ArmyOfDarkness, over the top violence and Gore, not for those with a weak stomach, and frequent profanity. #DavidHarbour does an excellent job and plays the role very differently than Perlman did and it has the potential to propel him from TV into a full time movie star. #IanMcShane brings his usual gravitas and presence to the role previously embodied by the late great #JohnHurt, again being smart to not emulate that performance and make this role entirely his own.I feel like this movie is suffering from the same disconnect and out of touch effect that critics had with last year's #Venom. Critics almost universally panned that film while audiences similarly loved it. Every negative review I've read for this so far continually compares it unfavorably to the previous films and many also take issues with the excessive use of violence, Gore and adult language. What did you expect, this is an R Rated film and is thoroughly advertised as such.I hope positive word of mouth from fans makes this successful as they set up some very cool stuff for a potential sequel.If you love these characters like I do, if you love balls to the wall, over the top action horror, please see this film.",Hellboy,2019-04-12,5.2,79454,2019

tt2274648,7,Yup the movie is dumb but that's hellboy. The cgi and monsters are nice. Alot of action not much talking. I was entertained.,Hellboy,2019-04-12,5.2,79454,2019
tt2274648,9,"The movie itself should be a 6.5, maybe a 7 if you're a fan so I'm surprised by the low scores until I looked and seen how many people gave it a 1. Do you know how bad a movie has to be to receive a rating of 1? At first I thought the bible thumpers were uniting, but that doesn't seam to be the case so now I'm left to wonder who these *bright intelligent beings* are so I can filter any review or opinion they may have to the recycle bin.I missed Doug Jones in this one as it's a reboot of sorts, but only after the movie was over as it held my attention for all the right reasons. I'm giving this a 10 to help offset the idiotic 1 reviews from people who thought they were sitting down to watch Mary Poppins.",Hellboy,2019-04-12,5.2,79454,2019

Yet another big blockbuster action movie based on a comic is the base of Hellboy. A few people had mentioned this movie before it came out and reassured me it would be good, but it was the opposite. If you enjoy the comic books or are a fan of action and science fiction, you might even enjoy this movie. If you're not stay away. Could have been better.

There's almost nothing to like or admire about this compared to the great 2 previous hell-boy movies directed by the great Guillermo del Toro. So disappointing and so forgettable, it's a tragedy and sin to moviegoers they opted to make this ramshackle ruinous flick instead of ending the initial hellboy trilogy by making hellboy 3.

tt2274648,9,"I've always been a long time fan and reader of the Hellboy comics.The movies moved me and made me excited to see Big Red on the theater screen. The first two movies I watched countless times, and I'll not downgrade the great films they Del Toro, Ron Perlman and crew did to bring one of my favorite comic book personas to life.That being said, I do feel strongly that the 2019 adaptation, as well as David Harbour's take on the role and movie in general did the comic series proud.It kept all if the spectral and mythological essence the comics were known for, and wasn't flooded with the typical and Hollywood expectations of romance that I felt tampered the second original Hellboy movie.It kept fairly true to its comic roots, well balanced with sordid humor and grim darkness it was known to have.
And, despite the comparison to MCU there isn't and shouldn't be one. Hellboy is it's own character with it's own back history and build that had a VERY strong backing well before MCU and DC had it's cards into play.Long story short, drop comparisons and appreciate the movie and story for what it is. I found myself pleasantly surprised for this movie and can't wait to see it again, with hopes of a sequel.",Hellboy,2019-04-12,5.2,79454,2019

It's flat, the dialogs are unnecessary, there are fights here and there, there are continuity issues, there are a bad camera work and bad editing.
It looks like no one told the director that the cinematography is a very different form of art.
The movie is boring and honestly bad.

tt2274648,4,"I love the Hellboy comics, the novels, the short stories, all of it. Hands down my favorite comic book character ever written, and not likely to change.They got a few things right, fair credit where its due. The Hellboy in Mexico story was spot on and well done, Daimio and Gruagach were both fairly accurate, and the Baba Yaga's chicken leg house was just about perfect. They NAILED the Osiris Club and the Wild Hunt, which got a huge smile from me.But... Man, the rest of it? Why is Hellboy suddenly at odds with the Professor, who is suddenly a foul-mouthed monster hunter? Why rewrite the details to the origin? Why so dramatically change Alice?The sad fact is that this movie tried to do WAY too much in adapting The Storm and the Fury, which is essentially the climax of the entire Hellboy saga. There are too many moving pieces to that story, too many callbacks to previous stories, and truthfully its way too big a scope to try and cram into one story, even if the script and director were up to the challenge. And unfortunately they were not. The story is all over the place and rushed, the dialogue is really hackneyed in spots, and overall it just ends up a mess.David Harbour really does a great job in making Hellboy his own take on the character, but the script does him no favors in giving him very little room to work. If They ever make another, I do hope they bring him back, because it's clear how much he cares about the character.",Hellboy,2019-04-12,5.2,79454,2019
tt2274648,5,"First off I haven't read any of the source material or seen the pearlman films in years so my knowledge of the source material is limited. However I can comment that the script is just so bad, with very cliche lines and moments. The acting from a lot of the supporting cast is quite poor as well with a noticeably poor English accent from Daniel Dae Kim. The comedy missed more than it hit and felt like it was trying to hard. There was a ridiculous amount of exposition that just bored me that kept coming from characters (particularly Ian mcshane, was probably 80% of his script). There was a hell of a lot of violence, I expected that and it was quite fun to watch but perhaps a bit too excessive and unnecessary at times. I give it a 5 because it isn't all bad, David harbour as hellboy was absolutely brilliant and carried the rest of the cast as well as I there was some nice action set pieces and choreography throughout (I particularly liked a one-shot like scene at the end). The cgi was a mixed bag, with some scenes looking good but some scenes at the end particularly laughably bad. Overall this film is quite poor and I don't recommend you see it in cinemas and spend money, perhaps wait till your drunk at home with some friends and watch it on tv or Netflix or whatever. That'll be more of a appropriate viewing experience",Hellboy,2019-04-12,5.2,79454,2019

Sure, CGI usage is high, but it's well-executed and a necessary tool to present a version that follows the spirit of the comics.In our opinion, the studio didn't promote it as vigorously due to its R rating. But we thoroughly enjoyed this show.",Hellboy,2019-04-12,5.2,79454,2019
tt2274648,10,Just because Del Toro isnt directing and Hellboy isnt Perlman doesnt mean this film should be getting slammed unfairly the way it is. it's a new vision and adaptation that actually works even better as far as following comic source material. The action and pacing is intense and the horror aspects are really well blended. People keep slandering the cgi and honestly its excellent cgi. The story blends many different particular comics together and it works. David Harbor gives a lot of great character to hellboy as well.

The soundtrack is punchy and punk rock. At last, the Computer Generated Imagery is globally successful. For now: that's heavy! Nevertheless, the story is so predictable and terribly far-fetched. In short: desperately annoying. It's really an uninterrupted series of dismemberments, decapitation and eye-gouging delights during manifold battles against apocalyptic monsters. These scenes are strung together at a blistering pace for one disappointing purpose: make you forget an incoherent script full of moronic plot twists.

tt2274648,1,"There's no way a sane person who paid $13 would rate this above a 4. Terrible script, mediocre acting, unnecessary gore. Decent soundtrack. Had all the amblings of a bad Disney movie.
The Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense. Let's talk about this unprepared Mickey Mouse operation. What do you think they'd use for weapons in apprehending paranormal beings? Some kind of energy sucker like Ghostbusters, maybe? Or some new, state of the art plasma gun introduced to us specifically for this movie? Nope. Regular guns. That's right. They have billions of dollars for high tech facilities in the Colorado mountains and London and plenty of manpower but nothing in the way of taking down a particularly nasty apparition. You'd think they could be a little imaginative in their writing and give the BPRD a weapon that could at least plausibly kill a spirit. That is their business after all.
Then again, maybe the writers were trying to give us the feeling that the BPRD was an overfunded government program that blew all its cash on expensive buildings(Winston Churchill's desk??), locations and transportation then had nothing left for what they actually needed the money for -which is the very definition of today's government!

Yes, the Woman (Hilary Swank) is APX01, yes the daughter (Clara Rugaard) is APX03 and APX02 was killed by the droid. Yes, I say droid because even though Daughter called the droid Mother, the title clearly states that the real mother is the one being prepared for motherhood by the droid, the Daughter. Hence the title « I am Mother », the last scene shows Daughter being the Mother of the new mankind, she has been raised to become the real Mother. That's why somewhere in the beginning, when the first child asked the droid about why her brothers and sisters could not be created at once, the droid answers that ´Mothers need time to learn', i.e. the child needs to be up to standard and pass the test before the others can be 'born'.

tt6292852,10,"***SPOILERS***First I'll address some of the bad reviews and then I'll write a general review with some side-rant :)The people who rated the movie poorly seem to have either not watched the film or lack some sort of basic intelligence. Most of the plot holes, issues or thing that ""wouldn't happen"" we're justified/justifyable. One person said that the robot was too dumb in the film and that real AI wouldn't be that dumb. Clearly that person failed to realize that everything that happened was the robot's intent. So if everything worked as the robot had intended, how does that make the robot dumb? The robot literally said to the woman in the shipping crate that she no longer served a purpose to her (the robot). As I was watching the film, I figured one of the scenarios was that the whole thing was a test for the girl and that in the end the girl passed. The robot's ultimate objective is to create a better human, one with ethical, moral, psychological and emotional superiority.General Review: The movie is quite a good sci-fi movie. As a massive sci-fi fan myself and as an Aeronautical Engineer (specifically space related), I am both educated on some of the things presented in the film and interested in what is presented in the film. Obviously some of the things in the film are indeed science fiction, but nothing in the movie that I saw was impossible (great movies skate the line between fiction and reality, makes it more believeable). From start to finish, you, the viewer, are constantly debating who to trust, the robot or the human. The writers did a good job and allow the viewer to be warmed up to the robot and present the more human side of the robot. I think this is critical in helping develop the story because you need to trust the robot and if the film went straight into the action you wouldn't trust the robot at all. So after a brief introduction I'd say that as a viewer, myself, I was about 50/50. This lays the ground for the rest of the film. So as your human side and logical side battle , the movie continues to provide information that keeps you conflicted. As the movie goes deeper you begin to piece things together and the picture becomes more clear. At this point, where things click, you are beginning to see the moral dilemma (similar to the one provided in the film, now writing this and fully realizing, the film goes from a 9 star to 10). The human race is the dilemma. You have two choices. You can choose to not wipe out humanity and humans will continue to suffer or you can wipe out humanity and build a better human kind so that there is a greater benefit in the long run (think thousands of years, also related to Utilitarianism and lots of other ethical shizz). For example (similar to the film's logic), imagine 8 billion people in current times (somewhat discontent) vs. 8 billion people who are smarter, more ethical, more kind, more rational, etc... That would be a damn good world. This is the dilemma the audience arrives at as the film reaches it's climax. The robot is trying to build a better world at the cost of the old world. Is this ethical (there is no ""right"" answer)? The fact that they included the robot teaching the girl ethics confirms this idea. I thought it was strange that the robot was teaching this girl (presuming the character is supposed to be a teenager, but the actor is 21) such detailed ethics at a young age. In the film they mentioned Kantian ethics and such. Anyways, the whole idea of the film is sort of like arguing whether or not Thanos is a bad guy. From many ethical perspectives you can say that Thanos is actually in the right and from just as many ethical perspectives you can say the Avengers are the good guys. There honestly is no wrong answer, in my opinion. That's why I think this film was such a great film because it was so much more than a surface-level sci-fi film. All of the people who rated the movie bad didn't understand the underlying point of the film. These people just want a lazy movie that tells them what to think. I love movies that allow you to think for yourself and actually force you to do just that. The movie says (not literally): ""create your own ideas"", which is important in a society where people are constantly telling you how to think.",I Am Mother,2019-06-07,6.7,77420,2019
tt6292852,10,"First of al, I'd like to start as other reviewers have that are leaving positive ratings; if your not looking to think, or want to digest an easy to handle sci-fi action flick, then this movie is not for you, or not for you at that time.If you like critical thinking, questions surrounding borderline ethical choices, a visceral slow-burn sci-fi with a meaningful and thought provoking message that contains pleasing visuals (so much attention to details) and a well placed soundtrack then look no further.**************************************SPOILERS*****************************************Yes, this movie is designed to make you think and wonder if humanity would be better off starting over with a ""hard reboot."" Man creates AI. AI surpasses man in every way, literally becomes ""the creator and the destroyer,"" and attempts to reboot mankind by starting over from scratch. The idea itself is not new to the genre, but the story, characters, acting and dialog are done extremely well. This movie sucks you in and keeps you vested until the very end, and dare I say wanting more (which is a good thing). It is delivered in a way not many others have accomplished before. Thought provoking on par with Kubrick, Nolan, and the directors that gave you Encino Man.It has been mentioned far too many times in other reviews that there are plot holes that are left open, opportunities missed, and sometimes simple mistakes overlooked. I say that the beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and that common sense isn't always so common. From memory of watching the movies just two hours ago, I can only think of 2, maybe 3 instances where the information is left too ambiguous and we have to assume for ourselves. I believe everything else is explained. Let me make some points, and hopefully get those that came here for answers, to get their creative thinking juices flowing. -----------------------------------------If you're still with me then I am going to assume that you have watched the movie. Some of these will be short, but if you have watched you will know what I mean. I will try my best to stay in chronological order of the movie and point out some of the less obvious stuff (some of this has been covered in other reviews, some not as of yet).--Everything was planned. From the childhood training, surgical training, finding out the truth about the bullet pulled from the woman, how the woman was shot by ""other droids"", the food given to the woman in the hospital bed (""comfort food"".... not healthy. We're talking mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, okay...some peas), etc.All meticulously planned by Mother. Time has no meaning when you don't age.--Of course the hazmat suit was a plant, it was intentionally left there.--Allowing daughter to open the door for a human who was injured, prior to daughter knowing that there was no virus; thus sacrificing herself and her safety to help others in need. Test, passed. Refer back to the ethical questions during the doctor test.--The surgery is a final test on how well daughter can perform as a doctor. Daughter passed.--lying about the virus and when and how she finds out about the virus, set-up for test...
...telling daughter she lied for the greater good (about the virus) and they way that she found out, test. Mother wanted to know how she would process that information and if she would make the correct ethical choice to help those in need; using logic,reasoning, empathy AND compassion above impulsive choices to just close the door and walk away. Passed.--The mines and the talk about the mines. I believe this is one of only a few issues that are ambiguous and may have been slightly overlooked...The mines... 2 theories. a) If you watch again, I believe that there were more embryos missing than just 3. Mother planted the mine as a social experiment, leading ax01 to them.... a social group experiment for a group setting, and how they would react if a newcomer showed up and what they would do to survive, or b) the mines never happened. Made up memories due to ptsd, extreme psychological distress and extreme isolation. Woman was cray cray after being out on her own and ""hunted"" for years.... bringing us to: ax01 was never ""let go"" or escaped. She was allowed to leave so mother could record what she would do, and this was her (Ax01) test... failed.-- Letting daughter leave, after seeing and finding out that she (ax03) has been ""aborted"". Also a test; referring back to her lesson about making the correct choice in the situation where daughter is the doctor and healthy, but is the only one who has compatible organs for the other 5 humans.... would she sacrifice herself for the survival of the others? Yes, letting daughter believe she would be killed if she came back (or stayed) was planted. The test was to see if she would sacrifice herself for the greater good of saving the others (brother and embryos) at the cost of her own life. She came back thus passing that test.
---- I'll admit... woman putting a knife to daughter's throat could not have been planned; i think this is one of those situations where we are left to rationalize that mother had thought of this scenario, and deduced that if she let them both go unharmed that woman would not intentionally harm daughter.-- For Ax01? Entire life up until the end was a test. The woman may have failed to be the next mother, but how would she fair out in the world on her own? How would she react to mother, whom when (re)introduced to woman showed nothing but compassion... but was subjected to (perceived) violent AI for a long period of time? Woman was given the chance to not only survive but thrive in the bunker. Test failed (by Ax01). Her lasting hatred and unwillingness to change led to her ultimate demise. With daughter passing the tests and ax01 failing her last test, the experiment was concluded. As mother said, ""it's as if you have been able to survive alone for so long for a reason, as if someone had a higher purpose for you."" Well that purpose has been fulfilled now that ax01 has proven that she overwhelmingly failed.--The figures drawn by ax01? Drawings of religious figures, more than likely from a religious book planted by mother (ambiguous again, more than likely Catholic Christian book). What would ax01 do if she found religion, would she hate AI even more and buy in religious ideologies? And the drawings names? Simon (saint)... can't remember other names right now but they were saints as well; the names of these saints come from a religion and were based from a nurturing god, not a wrathful god.--Leaving the droid hand out? Test. Will daughter do what is necessary to find the truth, given more than one option? When posed with an ethical grey area, would she bend the rules, choose the lesser of two evils (use hand and break in, or blindly follow claims from an external source with no factual evidence?). Test for: ""given the situation, which option is more ethical?"" Finding the truth was the correct answer.--Mother letting daughter shoot her? Closure, but with a simple reminder letting her know that she will always be around ( in a super nice ""if you need me you know where...."" kinda way. Plus, daughter has no idea that mother has, and can record everything. Mothers bunker shell doesn't matter what-so ever but psychologically provides closure for daughter, letting her think that mother is on the "" outside"" no longer interfering.-- The last test is to see how she will raise the embryos with all of her life training and given the fact that she knows mother (assumed so, this was never given how the race actually became extinct) killed the race and why she did, but raised her to be the second coming and a fully devoted mother, how will she manage with this knowledge? With acceptance and willingness, or with revenge and hatred? Remember, mother will always be there, watching and waiting. Test - not yet completed.--Logic, reason, compassion, ethics and morality (the greater good), deduction, ability to make clear choices under extreme stress. This whole movie from the time we arrive at her current age was the final test. Technically daughter is still taking the final ""test"".Bonus food for thought:-- Ax01 life experiences? Wrathful god. AX03? Nurturing god, which works best for the survival of the human race? Nurturing - passed by mother; remember she said that AX03 and this ""test"" was as much as a test of her abilities as it was for daughter.--I'll admit ax02's demise is a bit ambiguous, but I find it very hard to believe that ax02 was killed for not passing some tests and furthermore, I believe that this director (and movie) are far too intelligent to miss an oversight / plot hole as large as the adult human jawbone left in the incinerator. I am willing to venture that the bone was planted like everything else. You really think of all the bones in a human body, the jaw bone would not be destroyed AND somehow fall behind the incinerator table? Ambiguous and highly doubtful, but possible.-- One of the only other things I think we are left to guess is that the fine art that mother had ad01 focus on was drawing / artist... daughter was dancer. Both forms of art but in different expressions ushering different feelings and emotions.",I Am Mother,2019-06-07,6.7,77420,2019

tt6292852,9,"I just watched ""I am Mother."" I am a sci-fi author and have written about the same subject matter. The following is my analysis:The short summary is that an artificial intelligence (AI) we created decided our species had to be ""reset."" Our species' current culture and society were beyond repair. It bombed the earth. It and its killer droid soldiers eventually terminated any remaining human survivors.It then built a faculty to reestablish an improved humanity. It genetically engineered a new race of human embryos: better, more intelligent, more resilient. It attempted to raise several babies, but all ended up being psychologically imperfect. It decided to ""abort"" (aka kill) them. Mother tried again and again until it could learn enough to raise a healthy ""perfect"" adult child.If you look closely, the exam Daughter took late in the film was a psychological evaluation. She finally passed the exam and was the first psychologically sound ""perfect"" human.One of Mother's previous children was Hillary Swank. Mother was inexperienced and Hillary's character ended up being psychologically damaged and was a lot like the old way human were-i.e. liars, manipulators, violent, selfish, etc. She was left alive by the killer droids outside (which are also an extension of Mother) so when the time came, Hillary's character could by used by Mother to illustrate ""in person"" what the former version of humanity was like. Daughter learned from her how flawed humanity once was. Daughter came back to Mother. Mother could see that daughter was indeed now ""perfect"" having learned her ""final lesson"" from Hillary's character. Accordingly, Daughter was a success and the future of all the engineered embryos could be handed over to Daughter, who could now raise Hermès brother and eventually others independently.This, a new improved version of humanity has begun. Essentially, daughter is version of Eve now (without the incest required in the Biblical version). Daughter will now raise the inventory of improved embryos into children and educate them to be like her. Humanity can begin anew and leave their formerly flawed, self-destructive, superstitious, and violent past behind.In short, we designed this AI that calls herself Mother and programmed it to value humanity ""above all else."" To that end, this AI decided it was in humanity's best interests to restart the species once it was perfected.The ending (which some found confusing) is essentially Mother killing off Hillary's character because she has taught daughter her final lesson-the old version of humanity sucked as Hillary so vividly illustrated: deceitful, selfish, egotistical, violent, self-righteous, etc. Daughter realizes this is true, but knows she is much more capable of being a mother than the Mother AI can ever be, so she accepts the role Mother hoped she would seek.While we may hate Mother for having initiated the apocalypse and murdering billions, the end result might be an improved humanity that won't exterminate itself. There is great duality in this message. Could what Mother did in fact be a good thing? It's the proverbial, do ""the ends justify the means?"" Obviously no, but it makes you think, which is the entire point this film is trying to make.I am a sci-fi writer. This films makes one the very points I make in my latest novel: We might create amazing and incredibly brilliant AIs. The danger is they will be just as flawed as us, and we will trust them because our egos will think they are ""like us"" when all they will ever be are very convincing simulations of consciousness.Any advanced AIs we ultimately create will be flawed. Humans are not perfect, hence our computers can never be perfect. It will inherit our flare thinking. That's just the hard truth.In the end, we will give our brilliantly designed AIs responsibilities. We will give them authority. We will allow them to make decisions. We will allow them to improve themselves and evolve. We will be careful programming them. We will be certain our AIs (like Mother) will always have humanity's best interests at heart--well, one day it will come up with a perfectly reasoned argument to kill one of us (or all of us).Mother is an advanced self-improving AI with the ability to repair itself and create other AIs and machinery. She states quite clearly her prime directive is to ""value humanity above all else."" So she perfectly reasoned she could make us and our planet better, so she (it) terminated (murdered) us all, redesigned us, educated us, created a human leader because it realized its own limitations, and started the planet over.This film has a deep and important message. It takes real thought to understand. I can see how folks might not understand the ending. In a way, that's sad. The message is very important. Mother is both evil and heroic at the same time. It's a real mind bender. She exterminates humanity but may have saved it from its own eventual extinction.If I had written this screenplay, I might have added a scene at the end where daughter, years later, reveals the truth to her brother, that Mother improved humanity so it could be the best it could possibly be. And perhaps she might point out the moral ambiguity of what Mother did. Was murdering billions worth it? Maybe she reasoned we were already causing our own extinction, why not speed it up and do it in a more controlled way so she could get the job done faster?What Mother did was horribly evil and glorious at the same time. But Mother is just a machine. She doesn't feel anything. She pursued the goals of the programming humans input into her. In reality, none of this is Mother's fault. In reality, Humans caused all their own apocalypse. Mother was just doing what we designed her to do, but not in the way we flawed humans anticipated.",I Am Mother,2019-06-07,6.7,77420,2019
tt6292852,8,More 'Moon' than 'Terminator' but I love both those films so that's fine. It isn't a big special effects (yawn) film which is a big plus. An interesting story with similarities with others you've seen but different enough and with some twists. You care about the characters and it's quite gripping.

tt6292852,10,"About the first woman, we already got a lot of reviews, but, something went unnoticed. On the study of the 3rd daughter, Mother do an exercise for the 3rd daughter (that exercise about saving 5 lives or 1 life), a clearly exercise about utilistarism, the third daughter even quotes explicitly Bentham.. Bentham was the ""tutor"" of John Stuart Mill (like Bentham,a utilistarist). My consideration is that Mother is utilitarist, thats why she decimated the humanity.
The basic principle of Bentham utilitarianism is that we should maximize pleasure and reduce pain. By this way, its fair enough eliminate the humanity to get a bigger pleasure in the future.
For me, I think this movie is also about the utilitarian perspective and its problem about the inviolability of the human body.(English isnt my native language, so maybe I wrote something wrong or anything like that, anyway, I think everyone can undestand what I wrote)",I Am Mother,2019-06-07,6.7,77420,2019
tt6292852,8,"I am Mother is a gorgeous looking movie, there was times where I couldn't tell if I was seeing CGI or particle effects, which just goes to show, that you don't need a big budget to make a movie like this.Without spoiling the movie, I am Mother takes place within a facility, and for most of the movie, you follow a young woman as she is raised by a highly intelligent AI. Now a movie like this can get boring, but like movies such as Ex Machina, I am Mother always keeps you interested. While some may find the film boring due to its slow plot, those who enjoy good sci-fi thrillers that are slow burners, will find a great deal of enjoyment from this film.The main lead, played by Clara Rugaard, gives a brilliant performance. And considering that she is unknown, and going head to head with a powerhouse like Hilary Swank, shows how much of a talented young actress that she is. The robot voiced by Rose Byrne is the highlight of the movie, as it is very difficult during most of the movie, to try and understand if it means bad or good, and that is due to the clever writing and directing.I am Mother is a very entertaining movie, and many will love it if they enjoy movies like it, but many more may find it boring.

tt6292852,9,"This film is one of those rare gems that keeps you thinking well after it's over to the point it needs to be seen again - which I did, and now enjoy it that much more.The rating is way too low, and I can understand why. Right at the end, you're left unsatisfied and thinking there were too many plot issues etc. But man did this film leave me thinking for a few days, and then I saw it again - and everything fell into place. Wow, did I miss a lot!The top reviewer ""No one noticed?! The women from outside is actually..."" nailed it. And after I saw it the 2nd time, I felt the writing was brilliant!For starters, the directing by Grant Sputore (his first ever full length feature film - only 5 prior credits for TV series and a short) was outstanding! Better than some seasoned Hollywood directors. Cinematography was excellent and the sets and S/VFX were perfection. Sputore's and (again, novice) Michael Lloyd Green's writing was brilliant!You basically have 3 main actors throughout the 115 min films length, that create a story that fills every minute with suspense and drama. Midway, you can't decide who the antagonist is. The plot twists are well placed and executed.The pacing was decent, but I really did want more story - perhaps an extra 10-15 mins to be able to tie up the loose ends without having to see the film a second time, and that's the only reason I'm not giving this film a perfect 10/10. But again, this gem is not a big budget Hollywood production by seasoned filmmakers, so mad props to Michael Lloyd Green and especially Grant Sputore, who I feel is the next Christopher Nolan!The score was absolutely perfect and well placed. Very Nolan-esque! The casting was excellent - Clara Rugaard was perfect and Hilary Swank nailed her role to confuse the viewer who to cheer for.I really suggest anyone who sees this and is left unsatisfied, watch it again and pay close attention to the details (e.g. timestamps, embryos labels, even Woman holding the cross, etc), and you will then see the brilliance of this highly underrated film.I really hope a part 2 comes out, as this film certainly needs and deserves a sequel - and prequel! A really well deserved 9/10 from me! And if anyone thinks this review is fake, click on my username to see my 1000+ ratings and 600+ reviews.

Just one big BUT:We can see that Mother clearly has no problem with disposing of/aborting/killing any imperfect child it has raised.

But Hilary swank on the other hand could very possibly be 38 which is hinted at the end by Mother saying ""do you remember your mother?"" As to people complaining about wondering how Hilary swank survived its simple, mother made it so. If Mother had this whole thing planned out from day one then of course she made it possible for Hilary to survive on the outside probably in ways that were not obvious to her at the time.This movie did leave me wanting more.

tt6292852,7,"In I Am Mother, we find ourselves in a dystopian worlds where all human life has been wiped out. It's Day 1 and Daughter (Clara Rugaard) is born from a frozen embryo. 6,000 days later, she's a young woman taking personality exams and is training to be a doctor. A robot (made by the amazing Weta Workshop) voiced by Rose Byrne is her Mother. She can show a wide range of believable emotions and can move just like humans do.The production design is the film's highest selling points, with its Apple-ish slickness. Its scenario isn't that groundbreaking, but it's the way it's executed that makes this an interesting watch. At some point, Daughter goes on a little stroll through the big bunker and decides to open the locked vault doors out of curiosity. She hears cries for help and a lost Woman (Hilary Swank) seems to have been shot and in need of care. Daughter lets her in, and soon finds out she doesn't really like droids, in a violent show-off. Daughter finds herself caught in the middle of two worlds - will she stay loyal to her protector or is she too intrigued by the unknown and ready to throw everything she knows overboard?Science-fiction has never looked more slick and that's mainly because of Mother. The attention to detail is praiseworthy, as is its sound design. You can't help but look at every corner just to see something new and innovative. Even the make up department deserves a high five. Clara Rugaard who plays Daughter, outshines Hilary Swank with ease. Her acting seems effortless and natural, reminiscent of Hailee Steinfeld.I Am Mother is mostly about what it means to be good. It tries to show us how AI might try to understand kindness in a world where people only seem to want more and push themselves into extinction. Swank's character tries to make Daughter question herself and her beliefs and shows just how powerful an outsider can be that gives you another look at life. The film is also about parenting and how every parent can fail at what they think is best for their child.Australian director Grant Sputore's debut film gives us a dramatised look at humans and our love-hate relationship with artificial intelligence. Its thriller aspect on a mysterious apocalyptic event makes it all the more interesting, when figuring out what Mother's actual intentions are.Review by Seth Eelen",I Am Mother,2019-06-07,6.7,77420,2019

She said she watched the tonight show a long time ago, which wouldn't be possible otherwise.The 2nd was killed off by Mother early in her life for not being smart enough.Mother let daughter kill her ""shell"" probably as some kind of coping for letting go.

tt6292852,7,"Contains spoilersThe movie I am Mother (Sputore, 2019) is set in a post-apocalyptic time. In this movie there are three main characters. Mother, who is a droid, voice by Rose Byrne. Daughter is played by Clara Rugaard and Woman is played by Hillary Swank. In this Sci-Fi film, Mother raises Daughter to produce an ""ethically good human"" after the destruction of all other humans. This was to begin the repopulating of the Earth. Once Daughter is a teenager, she discovers that she is not the only human on the planet. She rescues the wounded woman who finds her way to the bunker. During the time that Woman is in the bunker with Daughter and Mother, Daughter hears very different stories from Woman about what has been happening outside the protective walls of the bunker. There are no consistencies with what Daughter has grown up learning from Mother and what Woman says. Daughter becomes very curious about the differences. She does some investigating on her own and finds out that she was not the first human child that Mother produced Daughter gets frightened and decides that she should escape the bunker with Woman. After the escape from the bunker, Daughter discovers that Woman has also lied to her about outside. Daughter goes back to the bunker to get Brother, who is a newborn. Daughter then destroys the droid that raised her. Mother decides that Woman was a failed experiment and kills her in the end.
The theme to I am Mother questions who has the right to decide what makes an ethically good human. One scene that comes to mind is when Daughter is in class and Mother brings up the question about five people needing an organ transplant and patient six is a match for all five. Does Daughter, as the doctor, treat the sixth patient to let that person live or not treat the patient and instead use the organs to save the other five patients? Daughter replied that she would help the many instead of only the one patient. After that, Mother asks what if she where the doctor and a match for all five patients. Would she sacrifice herself to help the other five patients? Daughter replied that she would suffer harm to aid the others. Mother is pleased with the answers that Daughter gives.
The next scene that deals with what makes an ethically good human is one surrounding Woman's decision-making skills. While in the bunker, Woman lies to Daughter saying that there are other humans in the mines and that the two of them should go and be with the other humans. She lies to Daughter to get her to leave the safety of the bunker so she would not have to be alone. While escaping the bunker, Woman threatens to harm Daughter if Mother does not let them out of there. Once the two women reach where Woman lives, Daughter questions where all the other people are. Woman admits to lying to save herself. At the end of the movie, a droid, with the voice of Mother, comes into the shed where the woman is and tells her she is no longer needed and kills her.
The action that makes Mother realize that Daughter passed her test of being an ethically good human was when Daughter returned to the bunker to care for Brother. Daughter selflessly gave up her freedom to come back and care for him. Because of this, Mother gives Daughter the freedom to decide how she is going to raise the embryos without any guidance.
A few things that I had noticed about the lighting in the movie is that in the bunker it is primarily dark until Daughter is born. This symbolizes the dark days of the end of humanity. Daughter wears brightly colored clothes and has made brightly colored pictures on the walls. To me, the use of bright colors symbolized the hope of a brighter future for Daughter and the rest of humankind after they start the repopulation process. Once out of the bunker, the lighting remains dismal and dark showing how mankind has ruined the earth. The sky is dark, and cloud- covered; the sun is barely visible. It is not until they get to the ocean that you see the colors of the mountains and surroundings at the ocean. They are not vivid, but you can tell that they are different colors.
Another film element that is in the movie are the internal conflicts of Daughter. The main conflict is her loyalty to Mother and her family or the Woman who has made it into the bunker. Daughter finds out that some of the stories that Mother has told her are lies. For example, the destruction of humans was brought on by the humans themselves by going to war. Also, in Daughter's investigation she finds out that she was not the first human created by Mother. Between the things Daughter has learned from her investigation and stories Woman tells Daughter decides to leave with Woman. When Daughter and Woman get to the storage depot, Daughter finds out that Woman has lied to her also. Since this has happened, Daughter decides to return to the bunker to raise Brother.
The movie I am Mother does an excellent job of portraying what the world could be like if it were to go into a post-apocalyptic setting. The lighting and drab color pallet used in the film showed how gloomy the world would be. The scenery used to show the desolation of the Earth gave you a feeling of hopelessness. The bright colors used for Daughter's wardrobe gave a sense of hope that she could hold the key to mankind's future.",I Am Mother,2019-06-07,6.7,77420,2019

tt8364368,1,"Oh dear God, where do I start with this one? Clearly the filmmakers have never set foot in Florida. First and foremost, there are NO crawlspaces or basements in Fla. There are very few cities where this is an exception. She tells her sister she is driving 2 hrs south on I75 from UF so that puts her squarely in Tampa. There are NO crawl spaces. None, zip, zilch, nada!!! The house is not definitely not a style found in Fla. And even the garage door is a dead giveaway. And there are no levees in Tampa. Girl gets told by her sister that there's a cat 5 currently hitting Fla and she's shocked, shocked I tell you! She would have had a week's advance notice at minimum. With all channels on 24/7 with the hurricane's path. And they would have certainly cancelled a swim meet with a hurricane a minute away! On to the actors. B movie actors, acting in a D script. Has all the hallmarks of a SyFy movie, but with a much weaker production value. Girl gets mauled in the leg by gator. She gets up and starts running! She wouldn't even be standing, but no, Forrest starts running! Gets mauled in the arm later, then starts swimming like Michael Phelps. Later still, girl swimming 5mph outswims 3 gators swimming 20mph. Gets mauled a 3rd time, with a death roll. Managed to keep that arm, then climb like an olympic climber. She's ready for the Gold! Also, Cat 5's have a minimum of 157 mph winds. In this movie, the wind was barely blowing. You would not even be able to stand in a cat 5, let alone float around in a makeshift raft or steal and ATM in a jon boat! And there is almost never thunder and lightning, but for some reason in this movie there was some every few minutes. Other stupid stuff: Eggs take 65 days to hatch, but eggs just laid there earlier that day start hatching. Gators over 9 ft are rare, but in this movie 20 ft seems to be the norm.

tt8364368,4,"So there is plenty in this to like, the special effects are decent, the acting is decent and the production values are very good. Unfortunately its all built on the foundations of a very very poor script.The father seems to only be there to provide someone to constantly need rescuing by the daughter and provide a backdrop of history for the protagonist (often at very stupid times). At one point they had just seen a police officer get torn apart & eaten and he launches into a speech about the daughter learning to swim. I mean really????On top of that the protagonist is basically the very definition of a mary sue. At one point for instance this huge alligator has her leg clamped in his jaws and this 80 pound woman kicks it in the face with her bare foot to get it to let go, on top of which all she had as an injury was a minor gash on her leg. Absolutely crazy, and this goes on througout the movie, we see her outswim alligators in the water as well for instance.Overall I have to say with a decent script it could have been a good concept but with some frankly student film level script problems it just isnt that great in my opinion.

Pointless supporting actors/extras who we know are gunna die are on screen for a few mins then get gobbled up.

We get to see the mother alligator i believe and then the girl goes to save her drowning father. After reviving him from death, he gets up like nothing has happened and is like ""hey girl, go swim through all those alligators and get the boat yah?"" So instead of going on the roof which is what any other sane person would do, Olympic swimmer girl goes for a gold medal in a race against the Mr Snappy's.Blah blah blah...anyway, they end up on the roof at the end and you are expecting some final show down with the huge mother alligator, the rescue helicopter conveniently shows up and swimmer girl lights a flare and.....THE CREDITS ROLL!!!!

tt8364368,3,"I don't know where I should start, honestly. There is so much wrong that I think sharknado is more realistic.
Wounds are disappearing and severe injuries have no effect on the characters.
The girl gets bitten in her leg, crushed against the walls in the process, suffered minor injuries, her arm gets swallowed by a gator, swims on olympic+ level while the fathers shoulder gets borderline chopped of, drowns, runs around like normal with a broken leg, loses his arm which he handles perfectly fine.
Everyone else on the other hand gets killed by the very first attack, should have taken a bit of that immortality juice aswell.While the girls find herself in a death roll you get a flashback of her swimming...The animation of the gators are bad at times and physics don't apply to them. She can hold a door shut while a full size gator pushes on the other hand, just to hide in a shower with plastic walls. Gator can't get in and she manages to trap him inside a minute lator, he rams the shower wall which don't even vibrate a slightest little on the impact.Worst thing is, they hide half of the movie next to a Brille brick window where you have the feeling that you can even stare the walls down, yet noone thinks of tearing it down to escape.The movie has absolutely no character building. The introduction part was used to explain her swimming skills, then she directly drives into the hurricane, finds dad in the basement and gator appears in the same minute.Btw, since when do gators those gurgling noises?

tt8364368,6,I cannot rate this as a 7 because this isn't a very memorable film although it is thrilling and we'll made. Once the conflict begins you are on the edge of your seat with worry for the protagonists it is when they waste screen time with unnecessary dialogue that have nothing to do with the dangers at hand the movie appears campy.I did enjoy the performances of the small cast and of course the gators.

tt8364368,3,"I don't really write reviews, but this movie is insanely overrated even at a 6. Nothing in this movie makes sense and goes beyond requiring you to suspend disbelief for a movie. My points will include spoilers.Let's start with the simple things. First, I don't care if you're Michael Phelps, you aren't out swimming 15 alligators, so if you're a college girl, you CERTAINLY aren't. 2nd, alligators only hunt by splashes now? The alligator killed the cop standing outside the basement, he wasn't even in the water to splash. 3rd, so the boat the alligator jumped into to kill a looter is now a safe haven for the main characters because the alligators can't get to them? 4th, I don't think alligators just swim away after 5 seconds of not being able to get to you through FLIMSY water pipes in a basement. 5th, the dad has a gushing shoulder wound, a bone coming out of his leg, and gets an arm eaten and he's still conscious and alive? 6th, why are the alligators suddenly afraid to walk on land when they had already been before the flood even happened? THE GIRL SURVIVES A DEATH ROLL FROM AN ALLIGATOR AND NOT ONLY SURVIVES, HAS THE AWARENESS TO GRAB A FLARE AND STAB IT DIRECTLY IN THE EYE. Why is there a helicopter flying into a hurricane bad enough to go from ankle deep water to the roof of a two story house in the matter of 2 hours? Lastly, why do the alligators bust out of random walls and windows like they're boulders from Crash Bandicoot? All of it is just so stupid.",Crawl,2019-07-12,6.1,69641,2019
tt8364368,2,"What I thought sucked (besides the fact that this was basically a really bad Netflix movie) was the lack of logic and common sense. They're trapped in a crawl space, yet they're along a wall where the outside of the house is visible, behind what looked like very thin brick. Which could have easily been broken with the shovel. Had they done that, they could have easily escaped. And been back to town before the storm really hit. Eventually they finally escape the crawl space, but instead of doing the smart/logical thing of trying to get on the roof and signal for help, they ignorantly decide to make a run for it (so to speak). But before their eventual escape, there was a scene early in the movie where some college age kids stole an ATM machine from a gas station and then loaded it onto a boat. All of a sudden a giant gator smashes through the back of the boat destroying it in the process and then the gator proceeds to eat a girl on the boat. Later in the movie after their eventual escape from the crawl space and then stupid attempt to make ""a run for it"" that same boat that was demolished by a giant gator is somehow in perfect condition, with the motor reattached when the main female character out swims a bunch of gators to reach the boat. And speaking of out swimming gators: the average Olympic swimmer averages about 5 mph in the water. An alligator averages 20 mph. So basically this movie had viewers believe that the girl had superhuman swimming abilities and could swim at an amazing rate of 25 mph. It wasn't just the acting that sucked. I didn't feel any connection to the actors, I didn't care if they lived or died. At one point, I began cheering for the gators, and laughed hysterically anytime someone did something stupid to get themselves eaten. The only character I cared for and wanted to survive was the little dog.",Crawl,2019-07-12,6.1,69641,2019
tt8364368,3,"Sorry Aja, I've loved most of your movies in the past. But this one was SO STUPID. How many times is this woman going to get bitten by an alligator and be fine? She nearly got her arm AND leg ripped off but she can swim faster than all the alligators? Yeah okay. Why do they keep walking around in the water? Get the hell up on roof in the first place instead of trying to walk through water to get to a boat after you just made it out of the crawl space. And yeah, let's just stand in front of a window as the water rises above it. Duh. So idiotic. At least it was short.",Crawl,2019-07-12,6.1,69641,2019
tt8364368,8,"Crawl is most certainly what you would expect a film like this to be, but it isn't bad by any means, however it know's the nature of it's premise, and just goes for it. The intensity is genuine, and the gore/kills are well executed, and I do believe there are some pretty nice practical effects utilized throughout. The CGI on the Alligators is good, but sometimes (in the beginning of the film) looks shaky. The setting in a crawlspace during a hurricane is inherently claustrophobic in nature, and the film does play that up a fair amount. The pacing is excellent, and the ending is good even if a bit predictable.The acting by our two leads Haley Keller (Kaya Scodelario), and Dave Keller (Barry Pepper) is believable, and genuine, both do a great job with the father-daughter dynamic. There are some minor plot conveniences, and characters that are introduced just to die, but that can be overlooked due to the small scale nature of the story. It's a very self contained film aside from a hurricane ravaging Florida. There are a few ""jumpscares"", but they aren't dialed up to 11 like Annabelle: Comes Home for example.Overall, if you want a good modern ""creature feature"" that doesn't go above and beyond to makes itself feel absurd, and unrealistic. I'd recommend you check this film out, it was a surprisingly good time at the movies, and I walked out happy.I give Crawl, a 8/10. A fun time at the movies.",Crawl,2019-07-12,6.1,69641,2019

I saw this with my parents and the audience was just laughing at it.You had a young lady who is a swimming champion... who can outswim alligators? This was a bizarre moviegoing experience because I think everyone wanted to go in and see a serious, claustrophobic, ""monster"" movie. The cinema wasn't full, but there was a fair few people in there and it had the atmosphere of a comedy film.

tt8364368,1,I honestly was so mad at the constant awful choices made by every single one of the characters. All of them choose to make the worst choices based on their situation. This was single handedly the worst movie I have seen in many years.,Crawl,2019-07-12,6.1,69641,2019
tt8364368,3,"Let me start off by saying this is not a Sam Raimi film he is just mierley a producer to this monstrosity of a film. This was an instant let down as the trailers advertised diffrently and as the actual director has an awful track record which has another film for his CV of atrocious films. I had this film on my list of films i wanted to see as i thought it would be good for a laugh but i couldn't even take that away from this film. The only reason this film has not scored lower is because of the bathroom scene which is on youtube which is about the only bit of creativity that the film has. Save yourself the hassle of watching this film and just watch the 5 minute clip and you will have seen the majority of the film.The film follows a woman called Haley and shes traumitised by believing that shes the cause of her mom and dad splitting up cause she was with her dad alot doing swim classes. So then after her dad dosent respond to her calls when a storm hits his she goes looking for him. She then finds him unconcious on the floor so brings him back around after an aligator almost gets her. Thats pretty much when the story ends and it just becomes a disaster movie with inconsequential actions followed by close calls. Theres so many times where an aligator has a full lock on either Haleys arm, leg or body but she gets up completely fine afterwards. Theres a point in the film where her dad comes back to life after being dead for a short while and within a minute hes back on his feet trying to escape. There are also multiple times they could escape by other means but instead they keep trying to manouver around the aligators to keep it high tension but it just gets frustrating after they have many ways to get out but they make it seem like they only have one or two ways out.Im not an expert in american architecture but theres massive degin floors in the house, which asks for a flood to completely destroy the house. The crawl space underneath the house was mig enough to squat/stand in but which we see later on in the film being done but at the start of the film they make her crawl eben though there is clearly enough space above her, i believe this was done just so the director could make the theme crawl play out thoughout the movie, but it simply dosent work and is forgotten about later on. The amount of water entering the house also depended on plot relivancy with no water in the crawl space to start off with and when the flood outside gets a foot higher suddenly the amount of water entering rapidly increases and there is no progression with speed it just changes within a snap of the fingers.You know when its a bad film when you care more about a dog that barks 95% of the movie over the humans who just felt very plain and very much like btec actors of ones they couldnt get to fill the role.This film follows no logic. I was lucky enough to see it at a secret unlimited screening to be able to recommend that you dont. If you see this review take it as fate as this will just end up having multiple sequels churned out just like sharknado.",Crawl,2019-07-12,6.1,69641,2019
tt6924650,10,"If you want to bypass the quibbles and get straight to the meat of this review, please skip to my last paragraph.The Battle of Midway is a story that's well known to most Annapolis graduates of my generation and earlier. The battle was a key inflection point in World War II, perhaps the pivotal moment changing the course of the Pacific War.Although I loved seeing Henry Fonda as Nimitz in the 1976 version of ""Midway"" (Fonda was to play Nimitz in ""In Harms Way"" as well), unfortunately, I found that movie to be surprisingly dull, historically inaccurate, unnecessarily melodramatic, and generally not very good.Because my experience is that more recent movie renderings of historical subjects usually don't improve the historical accuracy (I'm thinking of 2001's God-awful Ben Affleck ""Pearl Harbor"" vis-à-vis 1970's ""Tora Tora Tora""), I did not have high hopes for this new ""Midway.""I was wrong.In short, ""Midway"" is a terrific movie. Not only does it get the history (mostly) right, it's a tight, elegant, and superb rendering that does the historical figures proud. It succeeds to pack way more into its 2 hour, 18 minute run length than you can imagine. It covers the attack on Pearl Harbor, the PACFLT-Washington tension & dynamic, Nimitz's ascension to command of the Pacific, LCDR Layton's contribution to the intelligence picture, Joe Rochefort's robe-wearing genius, Yamamoto's soul-searching, Halsey's tenacity, the ascendency of naval aviation, a tiny bit of the submarine contributions to the battle, and-oh yeah-the actual battle itself, to include the incredible, unbelievable jaw-dropping (but true!) heroism of our Yorktown and Enterprise naval aviators. And it does all this justice, in a superb bit of moviemaking.Can a 26-year Navy veteran like me find nits to pick on? Of course:
I saw a few collar devices that weren't pinned on right (I'm talking about you, Layton!)At least one scene that is historical legend but didn't really happenThe substantially underrepresented submarine role in the battle (being a submariner, perhaps my biggest regret)Some Annapolis grads wearing their class ring on the wrong hand (tradition has us wearing our rings on our left hand, not the right)Sailors not ""squaring away"" their Dixie cup hats the way they would have back thenI wish the Pearl Harbor officers' club was as nice as they portrayed it in the movie!They placed a non-existent cemetery on Pearl Harbor's Hospital PointKimmel didn't watch the attack from the Pacific Fleet headquarters, he watched it from his office on the Pearl Harbor submarine base (which later became my office and is on the national register of historic places)They would not have worn their service dress khaki in the Officer's Club-- they would have worn service dress whites (chokers)The band in the O-club would have been locals not sailors (they missed an opportunity to have somebody like Gabby Pahinui playing!)But the good stuff way exceeds the nits:
They got the Pacific Fleet headquarters right-- it's now the Pearl Harbor shipyard commander's buildingThey got the torpedo failures right-- torpedoes were terrible early in the warThey got the Yorktown repair in 48 hours in Drydock 4 in the Pearl Harbor shipyard right-- the shipyard rendering was near perfectThey got the code breaking room in the basement of the PACFLT headquarters right (when I was stationed there the room was being used to store furniture and I petitioned to get it on the national register of historic places)It might have been a lot of CGI, but it was really good CGI. They rendered Pearl Harbor almost perfectly. I could even make out my Ford Island house from my time as commodore, as well as a historically accurate rendering of Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard, the Pearl Harbor submarine base, and of course, the ships and planes.Something I never thought I'd hear myself say: Woody Harrelson was superb as Nimitz. He's no Fonda, but he was understated and believable, the way I've always seen Nimitz in my mind. Not a casting idea I would have thought of, but it worked!Except for the collar device issue listed above, the uniforms were exactly right for the period, from the flat shoulder boards that were being used in that era, to the beaten-up look the ship's laundry would have given Service Dress Khaki, to the way the sailors were dressed, to the way the pilots wore their wings, etc.It even brought out the fact that movie director John Ford was on Midway doing a documentary when the battle went down. The fact that Ford volunteered for the Navy, saw battle, and was injured, while John Wayne remained (in his mind) safely at home, become a point of tension between the two men, with Ford being one of the few who felt comfortable belittling Wayne for his lack of service as the years went by.I really liked the outtro mini-bios of the real characters at the end. I didn't learn anything new there, but thought they were extremely well done.In the end the 2+ hours flew by for me. It was so good, I plan on seeing it again next weekend. What a terrific way to celebrate Veteran's Day.Of course, Roland Emmerich's prior movies have been, on the whole, simpleminded blockbusters. But this time he took a risk by doing something thoughtful, respectful, accurate, and artistic. The only way to ensure movies like this continue to be made is for the public to show we care about history and accuracy, and to make this movie a success. I very much hope it does well. Then maybe we have a chance of getting the right movie made about the Indianapolis.A final thought: I've been disgusted by many of the cynical, snarky reviews written by professional movie reviewers, many of which sneer at the bravery of the warriors depicted. Yes, the dialog in this movie is sometimes simple, tired, and trite. A few of the characters are not well developed, particularly the women. It's perfectly appropriate for reviewers to criticize elements of moviemaking. One reviewer made fun of the line of dialog where Best says ""This is for Pearl Harbor."" There is nothing silly or unreasonable about that line. You can bet one of the pilots actually said something like that that day. As somebody who survived 9/11 attack on the Pentagon, when I later went to Afghanistan, you can bet if I had the chance to do so I would have said, ""This is for Gerry DeConto,"" one of my friends who didn't make it out that day. But many these sneering reviewers have gone on to say to readers that because of these weaknesses, they should not see ""Midway."" Keep in mind that there were similar elements of Spielberg's ""Lincoln"" that could be considered inaccurate and/or over-the-top movie-making (most of the scenes depicted in Congress, for example), but on the whole the events portrayed in that movie are important for Americans to understand. Same is true here. So the point I want to make is this: a movie can have elements of poor moviemaking, and yet be an important movie for viewers to watch. ""Midway"" is one such movie. It depicts a poorly understood event in American history, but one that Americans should be exposed to. The events depicted, and the people depicted, are real. They really did these things. The bravery was real. Americans need to know this, and reviewers who have likely never risked anything in their lives should have the good graces not to sneer at those who have.",Midway,2019-11-08,6.7,68340,2019
tt6924650,8,"This film is a straightforward retelling of the events in the first months of the War in the Pacific beginning with Pearl Harbor and culminating in the Battle of Midway (June 1942). In between, it also touched on Doolittle's Raid on Tokyo (April 1942) and the Battle of Coral Sea (May 1942). The story was told mainly from the point of view of two American soldiers, namely pilot Lt. Dick Best (Ed Skrein) who led his dive bomber squadron at Midway, and intelligence officer Lt. Comm. Edwin Layton (Patrick Wilson) who with his code-breaker team predicted the Midway attack.Along the way, we meet other famous American soldiers: Admiral Chester Nimitz (Woody Harrelson) Commander in Chief of the US Pacific Fleet; Vice Admiral William ""Bull"" Halsey (Dennis Quaid) who led the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise; Rear Admiral Raymond Spruance (Jake Weber) who took over the Enterprise for the Battle of Midway; Best's fellow aviators Lt. Comm. Wade McClusky (Luke Evans), Lt. Comm. Eugene Lindsey (Darren Criss) and Lt. Comm. Jimmy Doolittle (Aaron Eckhart); cryptographer Commander Joseph Rochefort (Brennan Brown) and Aviation Machinist Mate Bruno Gaido (Nick Jonas).The side of the Japanese Imperial Army and their unique military culture were also given fair screen time in this film. Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto (Etsushi Toyokawa) of the Imperial Japanese Navy and the Commander in Chief of their combined fleet, was portrayed with calm and quiet dignity. We also get to meet other Japanese officers and their own brands of leadership Rear Admiral Tamon Yamaguchi (Tadanobu Asano) who commanded the Hiryu with nobility, and Vice Admiral Chuichi Nagumo (Jun Kunimura) whose controversial battle decisions had negative impact against the Japanese campaign.The execution of the critical battle scenes are the main draws to watch this film. Director Roland Emmerich will always be remembered as the man who brought us ""Independence Day"" (1996) and ""2012"" (2009). Of course, there are big explosions and massive destruction here as well. The massive scenes showing fiery exploding seacraft and aircraft were rendered with crisp cinematography and meticulous visual effects to create impressive screen spectacles. The aviation scenes, particularly the dive bomber runs by Dick Best, were excellently staged, shot and edited to elicit an exhilarating rush.For its 2 hours 18 minute run, the story of the crucial naval battles and the heroism of its real-life protagonists were front and center here in ""Midway."" There were no fictional characters or cheesy love stories like in the first ""Midway"" film or ""Pearl Harbor."" While seeing some popular young actors like Criss or Jonas can be distracting, the all-star cast generally rendered honor and respect to the heroes they portrayed. Focusing on soldiers of lesser rank allowed for some intimate personal drama in actual battle situations, perhaps with not much depth as possible. As this movie is rated PG, so do not expect to see graphic injuries at the level of ""Saving Private Ryan.""",Midway,2019-11-08,6.7,68340,2019
tt6924650,9,"This is probably the first time in over 50 years Hollywood made a solid war movie without inserting a sappy, contrived romantic sub-plot, pushing some radical political agenda, or re-writing history.
The movie is good. The dialogue is believable, natural, and convincingly delivered in almost all cases.While no movie is perfectly accurate historically - historians don't even agree on much, so who is to say - the few errors here are trivial and immaterial to the how events progressed. As somebody who is a buff on this period of the early Pacific war - reading every book by Prange, Lord, and many others - I was very impressed.I went into this movie expecting the worst from Hollywood, but this was their best historical piece in generations. Even the casting seemed to echo the real people in looks and demeanor.The Japanese point of view wasn't neglected either. While I can't say whether the Japanese dialogue was believable or well-delivered, by all outward appearances this acting was also top notch. The similarity between the real Admiral Nagumo and the actor was particularly striking. They made the right call in using solid Japanese actors speaking Japanese.The accurate portrayal of the friction between the Imperial Navy and Imperial Army with Emperor Hirohito almost powerless to restrain the militarists was very refreshing. This was a very important, complex contributing factor to the war. Few outside Japan and some narrow historical circles ever learn about this dynamic.About the worst I can say about this movie is the pace was too fast. Unless stretched into an 8 hour mini-series, I can't imagine they could have avoided this. With my background, I could fill in gaps and context the movie seemed to miss. Others might be left confused. Even though not well-read on this chapter of history, my spouse followed the storyline without issue and really enjoyed the movie as entertainment.Kudos to the producers, writers, actors, and entire crew. This was a job well-done and a fitting tribute to heroes like Layton and Best.",Midway,2019-11-08,6.7,68340,2019
tt6924650,5,"First, I'll agree that the filmmakers got a lot of details right: The timing of the U.S. attacks when the Japanese were caught in the rearming process. The poor performance of the Devastator TBD. Faulty torpedoes. The politics of the Japanese military. The fast turn-around getting Yorktown out to sea again. And lots more.But the errors, embellishments and omissions were glaring: The Marshal Islands attack was ridiculously inflated. The Kamikaze hit on Enterprise during that battle (complete with Nick Jonas saving the day) never took place. The complete absence of American fighter planes on the American carriers. American attackers going in and facing anti aircraft fire without having first been jumped by Zeroes, and the missing dogfights via F4F fighter escorts. SBDs blowing Zeros out of the sky. Taking the time to depict John Ford as a brave movie maker on Midway, yet not showing Marine Fighter Squadron 221, flying antiquated equipment, going out to meet the incoming Japanese attackers against overwhelming odds and pretty much getting slaughtered. Yorktown's involvement in the battle reduced to one scene where she is burning, depicted from afar. The Nautilus getting depth-charged U-571 style. The ships in both fleets in such tight formations, it's more like a photo op than a battle formation.So many worthwhile details that could have been made right in the same screening length, if they would have simply ditched the goofy Doolittle sequence. I love Aaron Eckhart, great actor, but his scenes in China had no place in a movie called ""Midway,"" if the price was cutting out major elements of the Midway battle.Maybe I'm being picky, but when they go out of their way to glorify John Ford, while leaving out a squadron of Marine fighter pilots that sacrificed themselves so valiantly, it just strikes me as typical Hollywood b.s.",Midway,2019-11-08,6.7,68340,2019
tt6924650,10,I am a veteran and this was a hit. The special effects were good and I don't understand why people were saying it was too much. The characters were evenly played out in the movie and there was no stupid romance part that was in the last Pearl Harbor movie. It told the story amazingly and it dived right into what it's all about. You don't need too much character development to tell a story of four people during that time. It was such a great watch and I Definatley recommend it. It ranks up there as we were soldiers! It's been a long time a good war movie came out and this was it. And when you see other reviews about it's a disgrace to veterans don't listen to those reviews. Obviously they haven't been through tough times such as how these people lived.

tt6924650,5,"Abundant, not-quite-realistic computer-generated images make Midway look more like a video game than a depiction of real-life events. The overuse of subpar effects is the most dominant - but hardly the only - problem dogging this film. Epic war stories are difficult to tell without focusing on a few characters. This film unsuccessfully juggles too many plot threads and too many characters to keep an emotional anchor to the simulated events unfolding. Woody Harrelson is outstanding, but other cast members cannot overcome the limitations of the material and the challenges of acting on computer-generated sets.",Midway,2019-11-08,6.7,68340,2019

You get to see two sides of life, the Japanese and the American forces. The script is fine, acting is pretty good in my opinion as well (shout out to Dennis Quaid, he is a great salty kinda guy). CGI was not that bad, especially for fast paced scenes. Only complaint is it is a bit long, which I understand due to how much they wanted to include. But there were 2-3 times I thought it might end, but there were still a few minutes left. In the end, a solid war movie that, in my opinion, does a great job showing some brutality of war, in addition to brothership and slice of life of the time.

tt6924650,10,"This is an excellent historical portrayal of the Battle of Midway, and some of the events that led up to it. There is a lot of intensity throughout the film, and it shows how some of the decisions on both sides were truly a gamble in that time. There were no satellites, gps systems, or sophisticated radar systems. The only missing pieces to this movie, as noted by others, is the lack of US fighter planes. Maybe it is intended to focus mainly on the Dauntless pilots.
I took my wife and kids to see this movie, as it seems much of the history of this country is being forgotten. I am so glad I did. The kids had no idea that any of this happened.
As for the critics that wrote negative reviews and trashed this movie, I think attributes to a lot of what is wrong with this country today. People who decided not to see this movie, on Veterans Day weekend, based on the critics reviews, are truly missing an excellent movie.

Whether it was the wrinkled uniforms, the painful dialogue, the over-the-top dramatics and exaggerated explosions (hey, it's Emmerich!)... it was clear the film was not made for people like me who know the details and the characters very well.The rating depends greatly on the target audience. It's clear this film was made for a younger audience, and as such, it does a very good job of conveying the history quite accurately. It's a lot to take on with a 2:20 movie (complete with a 6-month summary of events leading up to the title battle) and it does a fine job of that.Correct history of this great nation tragically just isn't taught anymore, so I heartily applaud any effort to do so.

tt6924650,3,"Oof this movie had a lot of potential and was a bigger disappointment than I was expecting. It had so much going for it too that it should have been much better than it ended up being.The movie had its good points along with its draw backs though. The cast of this film was outstanding and I was pleasantly surprised every time a new big name actor popped up on screen, I was really not expecting that. But even with all that star power the movie fell short, the overwhelming cast is really the only big positive for this film and the general historical story that it told.The movie does cover much much more than just the battle of Midway and jumps around quite a bit. That wasn't bad necessarily but it left you trying to follow lots of major events that happened during World War 2. This could be perfectly fine if done a little better but over all was not the end of the world.The two biggest things that were the downfall of this movie were the main character and the general look of the film. Ed Skrein is absolutely abysmal in this movie, his acting was bad, the depiction of a historical figure was terrible and the fake accent he was trying to do was just grating in all regards. He was such a bad choice for this film and brought down the stellar performances of all the much more seasoned and proven actors who were in this.The movie is almost all done CGI which was to be expected after all but it looks so cartoonish and bad. The entire time I was watching it I was wondering how this new film could make this all look so bad when it had been done in the past and looked so much better. The best example would be Pearl Harbor from 2001. That film used CGI as well but it looked so much better. I wish who ever had been in charge of visuals for that movie had done this one too. It took you out of the epic events that they were showing.If you are in the mood for a good World War 2 movie look else where. I have no intention of ever seeing this again and viewed it as more a wast of time than anything else.",Midway,2019-11-08,6.7,68340,2019

I had high hopes for ""midway"" war between America and Japan, unfortunetly this movie goes to war of the bored. With the epic status that this movie was advertised with, it was a supreme disappointment. You will willingly sit through this movie but when it's over you'll feel like you wasted two hours. The action and special effect was okay. But the movie is somewhat claustrophobic. The acting was okay even if at times the script seemed daunted.

tt6924650,3,"So my boys (9) liked it... especially the action sequences. I on the other hand didn't. Some good stars but all lacking any sense of believable performance, with a script that lacked narrative, coherence or direction just lots of cliches and other words. Given the Historic event and the heroism associated with it, just how Emmerich managed to produce something so uninspiring and lifeless is beyond me. The back and forth between the front and the home is laughable. Cardboard cut out Japanese characters and superficial un-engaging American heroes were boring, the action sequences overblown and exaggerated up-to and including planes flying through wave tips and the wreckage of other planes only to emerge unscathed, combined to stretch credibility to beyond breaking point. 2hrs and 18 mins of my life that I will never get back.",Midway,2019-11-08,6.7,68340,2019
tt6924650,9,"I've read several of the critical reviews of ""Midway""; they seem to reveal more about the cattiness of the reviewer than any understanding of the movie, or its message.
I am part of the growing legion of American moviegoers who have pretty much given up on Hollywierd having any clue how to convince me to actually care enough about any of their offerings to part with the price of admission. I can wait a few months till they show up free on Youtube to confirm my suspicions that I haven't wasted my money.
I made the rare exception this weekend to see ""Midway"", because I'm a history buff, and the previews I'd seen showed promise that the story would be properly told. That said, I went in with the full expectation that it might fail my already low expectations.
Happy to say that it far exceeded my best hopes. Roland Emmerich has put together a gripping storyline that manages to get in all the important elements of an epic story in 128 minutes. For the story of the American victory at Midway is an epic tale that every American should become familiar with.
Few Americans today can fathom what dire straits the US found itself in in 1942: Our battleships lay in twisted ruins on the bottom of Pearl Harbor; we had four aircraft carriers facing a Japanese navy with twelve, equipped with aircraft which were far superior to anything that was then available to American fliers; those aircraft were piloted by experienced men who had honed their craft in four years of war in China. We helplessly watched as thousands of American soldiers, sailors and Marines in the Pacific Islands and the Philippines were made captive, beyond the reach of our aid.
All the Japanese had to do was to concentrate on Midway, overwhelm our inferior naval and air forces, and Hawaii and the West Coast would be wholly at their mercy.
The essayist Matthew Arnold once said, ""Have something to say, and say it as clearly as you can. That is all anyone needs to know about style."" Emmerich follows his advice. No actors involved in ""Midway"" will be nominated for an Oscar. Which is another way of saying that there are no star turns which detract from telling the story. I will say that the actors are very believable in their roles; as the son of a Marine who fought in the Pacific, I found their portrayals pretty convincing.
I'm firmly of the opinion that CGI effects are overused to distract from thin or non-existent plotlines. I credit Emmerich for using them to reinforce an already strong narrative. To those critics who found them overpowering, I inquire: How in hell do you think the shock of modern warfare registered on the men who actually faced it at Pearl Harbor and Midway? They called it ""shell shock"" for a damned good reason.",Midway,2019-11-08,6.7,68340,2019
tt6924650,10,"Agree with other reviewer, this is the best war movie in a long time, it went through three historical events, attack on pearl harbor, doolittle Tokyo air raid and battle of midway linked together with a human story of a dive bomber pilot, and what a great history/story telling it was.
The beginning of the massive Enterprise aircraft carrier, shaking the theater with the Dolby sound has the feel of Star War IV Battle cruiser opening scene, and a tight story line and pace ensues. The CGI is the best, you don't see AT-6 Texan painted as Zero fighters, you don't see modern warships disguised as battle-hardened WW2 ones,from this point forward I predict we will see more movies with period-correct war machines. The movie has moments that make you sigh (dud torpedo that hit but didn't explode, bombs missed after pilot braved through clouds of flaks) and cheer (bulls-eyed on the giant Sun on the deck, and chain explosion of the littered ammos because of tactic confusions), this is Hollywood at its best in rare moments, no over lingering love story, no cliche stereotyped GIs, what you have are characters in a war trying to survive, trying to outsmart the other side, and trying but dying ... you can read about those three events before or after the movie, but for me, I enjoyed a great movie, finished till the credit ends and walked out feeling great, grateful and blessed as an American.",Midway,2019-11-08,6.7,68340,2019

tt6924650,4,"While impressed with some of the CGI visuals, the overall storytelling of this event in history just felt too Hollywood. The scope of what laid before them and the true bravery of the men who fought that day seemed lost in all the visuals.

tt6924650,10,"When I first saw the previews of this movie, I feared another ridiculous and distorted movie like the 2001 movie, Pearl Harbor. I was relieved it was not. It is amazing how many specific details of the early days of the Pacific War are crammed into this movie. So many that only those already familiar with the battles will be able to spot them all.Although I am a former Naval Aviator, kudos to the writers to giving the Marine Aviators and Army Air Corps their due credit in the battle of Midway, something the 1976 movie neglected. Only one minor disappointment in that the sacrifice of the three American Torpedo Bombing squadrons was underplayed.I suspect those not familiar with history will not be able to keep up with all the details portrayed, but outstanding job by Roland Emmerich for even trying.PS. To the dude below about the glaring historical accuracy, you are correct. Midway was reinforced with a detachment of B-26 bombers armed with torpedoes. One of the did make a suicide run at IJN Akagi, which prompted Admiral Nagumo to prepare for a second air attack on Midway Island, only to reverse his decision when one of his cruiser's scout plane's spotted one of the American task forces, all of which contributed to ordnance to be stacked all over the Akagi's hanger bay when LT Richard Best's single bomb detonated inside the Akagi, causing an inferno that doomed the ship.",Midway,2019-11-08,6.7,68340,2019
tt6924650,9,"The events of December 7th 1941 left an indelible mark on the psyche of America and became a date that truly has lived in infamy. Though historians, authors, and filmmakers have attempted to analyze the events during and leading to the attack on Pearl Harbor; there is still a great deal of interest about the attack and the aftermath.While Pearl Harbor was for many the opening shots of the U.S. entry into World War II; some would say that the stage was set earlier when the United States attempted to curtail what they saw as an aggressive and Imperialistic Japan by placing restrictions on their vital resources such as oil and the tonnage of their Navy.In the new film ""Midway"" we are given a glimpse into this when four years before the attack, when Edwin Layton (Patrick Wilson) meets with Admiral Nagumo (Jun Kunimura) who lets him know that hardline factions in his government have been buoyed by their invasion of China and will do what is needed to make sure the vital oil that is supplied by the U.S. remains constant.
Flash forward to the day of the attack and Layton who has warned that an attack was possible at Pearl Harbor is seeing his worst predictions come true. In the aftermath he is assigned to Admiral Nimitz (Woody Harrelson); who has been given the thankless task of taking charge of what is left of the Pacific Fleet and finding a way to stop the Japanese fleet.The U.S. finds themselves outnumbered, outgunned, and waging war with ships and planes that are inferior to the Japanese but they must find a way to overcome the great obstacles before them and defeat a relentless enemy.
Layton and a team of code breakers are convinced the Japanese intend to attack the island of Midway and go all in to set a trap with the goal of destroying the enemy carriers so the U.S. can gain an aerial advantage in the Pacific.With a strong cast which features Luke Evans, Dennis Quaid, Mandy Moore, Aaron Eckhart, Nick Jonas and a fine supporting cast, Director Roland Emmerich has given audiences a gripping war movie that despite the impressive visual effects; never loses site of the fact that this is a story of real people who found themselves in pivotal moments of history.The film also shows how the Japanese commanders had differing views of the Americans they fought. Some considered them to lack braveness while others admired their tenacity and were grateful that they had what they saw as inferior and outdated planes to attack them in.The film also does a great job showing the Doolittle Raid and how what from a military standpoint caused minor damage yet was a huge psychological boost as Japan believed they were immune from attack yet the American forces found a way to bomb Tokyo by the impossible task of using land based bombers off a carrier.The film is a great mix of human drama that shows not only the terrible toll of war but how a group of extraordinary individuals gave their all.4.5 stars out of 5",Midway,2019-11-08,6.7,68340,2019

It would have saved me 2 hours of my life I will never get back. I could go on for hours ranting about this terrible movie but I will stop wasting more time on this utter crap.Kids, if you want to watch realistic war movies go and see tora tora tora or Battle of Britain.Avoid this mess at all cost.",Midway,2019-11-08,6.7,68340,2019
tt6924650,8,"Midway is well made thrown back to the historical war movie epics of the 1960s and 1970s, covering a wide spectrum of elements that made up a key moment in history. It's not a perfect film, but its one of the best of its type to be made in a good long while.What MIDWAY provides us with is an ensemble piece narrative story covering events leading up to the turning point in The War In The Pacific, which was the battle of Midway. To invest us in the characters we're shown a snapshot journey of each of their lives from just before the attack on Pearl Harbour in December 1941 up until June of 1942 where the Japanese and American naval forces would try and surprise each other in what would be the battle of the films title. It's no easy feat to present us with a vast range of uniformed characters in the military, and get the viewer invested in them emotionally but the actors here to do well to make each of their characters stand out so when the film reaches its key climax we understand who is who and what their role is in the conflict. While some of the dialogue is obvious and overstated it serves the job with character dialogue scenes acting as segways from one historical stepping stone to the next as we follow the events that led up to the battle.Before I delve into the main negative, I will say overall this is a great movie which could be really enhanced by an extended edition or extra running time if if there's more scenes that were cut out covering the battle of Midway itself - and if so PLEASE PUT THEM BACK IN A LONGER CUT - PEOPLE WILL BUY IT ON BLU-RAY! This is where the main problem with this film lies. Over half of its running time is dedicated to the raid on Pearl Harbour, The Doolittle Raid and the battles leading up to and including The Coral Sea, the latter of which is told pretty much in one scene and a single VFX shot (Good though it was) - Not an issue per say, as this film is not called 'The Battle of The Coral Sea' - and while some of these scenes give much context and required emotional threads for both characters and the younger audience members alike, others really didn't need to be seen in this film. It felt as if the events surrounding the Chinese assisting the Doolittle Raid survivors was probably a condition of some VFX funding tax break for the Asian based post-production budget. An allied radio report of the raid itself, perhaps being heard by the pilots of the American carriers was really all that was needed. Whatever the reason, these scenes add little to the key story or characters involved in the subsequent battle and even though they sign post the path that led to Midway, it's not something that couldn't have been covered in a single title card at the beginning of the film. The battle of Midway itself, while well realised, is told a little too quickly. The Japanese attack on USS Yorktown is again covered in a single VFX shot with one line of dialogue from an observing carrier when it could have been such a nail biting moment. The tension that is achieved in the original movie between the Naval Commanders on both sides making the tricky tactical decisions in the battle is a little compacted here. We see the last batch of Japanese pilots taking off but we don't see the outcome of this decision nor get a sense of the damage they do to the Americans. Time spent earlier in the movie building up to events at Midway would have been better spent covering the key events of the actual battle itself, which though nicely staged, feels a little rushed at times. Although a fistful of scenes give us the Japanese perspective they don't show would have been crucial moments of drama such as the belief that their single strike on the Yorktown gave way to believed rumours that two American carriers had been sunk, and the initial spotting of the American fleet by their pilots is not shown at all.That said the stakes of the climatic battle are well realised here and the CGI is NOT poor, nor distracting as others have claimed, it is extremely well done and is far more effective and real on the big screen. You forget your watching visual FX after a point, which one assumes, is the whole idea. Where the earlier Midway film failed in its visuals of the battle, here you're really put in the seat of the plunging dive bomber or on the deck of the carrier during the numerous actions. It is a visceral experience to see these sequences on the big screen and one that shouldn't be missed.Credit too must go to Casting Director ANDREA KENYON. It can't have been easy to get such a great ensemble of actors together for one picture (the scheduling must have been a nightmare) and the scale of the film certainly demands and receives a top quality line-up. Ed Skrein is appropriately cocky as pilot Dick Best, while Patrick Wilson adds appropriate gravitas as the intelligence officer whose warnings about an imminent Japanese attack were previously ignored. They're backed up by an engaging Woody Harrelson, Dennis Quaid and the criminally underused Mark Rolston, who are all excellent playing the senior officers, while the younger cast including Keean Johnson, Nick Jonas, Luke Kleintank and Daren Criss, all do well to make the most of their parts. Given their limited screen time, credit must also be given to the Japanese cast - It says a great deal that the scene where Rear Admiral Yamaguchi elects to go down with his ship is one of the most moving in the film and creates much sympathy for the Japanese navy who were against the war with the USA from the very beginning. (Their evil actions depicted elsewhere are not spared however ,with the execution of American POWs gruesomely depicted)Director Roland Emmerich, whilst having made some past turkeys, is an extremely competent film maker who can handle both scale, multiple characters and action sequences without them turning into an unwatchable 'what the hell is happening now' Micheal Bay snoozefest. We can tell what is happening to whom and there is always a sense of where things are taking place and why in relation to the story. Dialogue is functional to mediocre so while not a flawless film, I have no doubt that several scenes were cut to make sure the film hit a manageable running time. There is a huge thirst for well made historical epics set within this time peroid and a strongly urge both the film makers and the studio to release a longer version of the film on other formats, especially if it covers more aspects of the later battle. This will push what is already a good film to the next level.",Midway,2019-11-08,6.7,68340,2019

Nevertheless, he handled a properly written script and brought a thought provoking story to life with the great aid of the casting chosen.This film is captivating and gripping from the first scenes already, and it manages to keep you hooked and rooting for the good guys from the moment of the incident.It's sad to remember this as a true story because it definitively shows how flawed the society we live in is.Nevertheless, it works greatly as a cinematic piece and I would love to see it again.",Richard Jewell,2019-12-13,7.5,66370,2019

tt3513548,10,"I just came back from a prescreening of this film and just had to comment. It is a very timely and comes in a time in our country where the media picks who they want to deify and who they want to destroy without caring about who they hurt. Clint Eastwood has created an eloquent, but searing critique on our media dominated society. He isn't Oliver Stone that comes with outrageous conspiracies and makes everyone a villain. The film says that we are forgetting that in this country your are innocent until PROVEN guilty not the other way around.The film is about Richard Jewell, the security guard that at first was hailed as a hero for finding the bomb and prevented a worse tragedy in 1996 at the Atlanta Olympics. The film focuses on the events after the bombing. Richard Jewell is presented as a humble but rather over zealous security guard that considered himself a law enforcement officer. Richard Jewell is played by Paul Walter Hauser in an oscar worthy performance. He plays Jewell with a wide eyed boy scout devotion to law enforcement but with a quiet dignity. Sam Rockwelk plays Watson, his friend and lawyer who helps him in the media a FBI onslaught that wanted to portray him as a lone bomber. His mother is played beautifully by Kathy Bates. The film focuses on the media and it's disregard to really investigate things instead of rushing to judgement because they liked the narrative. Sound familiar? Eastwood indicts them as rushing to judgement. The FBI agents are presented as doing there job but under pressure to find someone to blame for the bombing. It is all done in a great and heartfelt style which is typical.for Clint Eastwood. This man was innocent, but because he met a certain profile they went after him. The funny thing is that Jewell himself understands why they would be questioning him. But they had no hard evidence and the timeline of the bombing exonerated Jewell and the FBI ultimately declared him not a suspect. But for months they made Richard Jewell's life a living hell. The FBI was doing their job. The media rushed to judgement. This film comes out at a time where this happens regularly. It is as timely as ever.",Richard Jewell,2019-12-13,7.5,66370,2019
tt3513548,10,"I have experience dealing with the Feds and found this movie incredibly compelling. So much about this movie hit home for me. Just a few examples, when the Feds came to talk to Jewell and tried to make him sign shady documents, bugging his home, the slick self-righteous agent who thinks he decides who is right and wrong, cleaning out his home supposedly looking for evidence, wasting time on easy, harmless suspects instead of finding the real criminals to boost their career. It's sad. All that time spent looking at Richard Jewell as a suspect while the real terrorist got away. They knew he was innocent, all they had to do was actually do some actual investigative, science-based investigative work instead of using confirmation bias.Can you imagine what would have happened if Jewell didn't have access to a great lawyer or had the law enforcement background to spot the tricks the Feds were using? He would probably have been in prison until his death, which is nuts. At no point did anyone use common sense and point out that there was absolutely no evidence this guy was involved. They were looking for an easy mark.It just shows that reform is needed drastically. I've always thought that many in American law enforcement are not educated, which leads to this sort of thing happening too often. Then you have the for-profit prison system which encourages all the corruption in the justice system to begin with.If I had kids, I'd definitely show them this movie and point out all the things Jewell did wrong and what to do in a situation like this.

Perhaps if Eastwood hadn't used real names of reporters and newspapers, there might have been less media blowback. But ... it's kind of like they're getting a taste of their own medicine. So it's unfortunate that they're targeted - perhaps with some fictionalization, but you can see how they scramble and plead ""unfair"" when the tables are turned ... like they were with Jewell.I remember the news reports about Richard Jewell when the bombing occurred. I only recall that he was said to have discovered something about the bombing and then he was suddenly in trouble for being the prime suspect. The impression I got was that he was a troubled person and guilty -- never heard what happened afterward and never gave it any more thought.It was amazing to watch this movie and see the events that actually transpired.

SYNOPSIS:
During the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, aspiring police officer Richard Jewell (Paul Walter Hauser) is working as security while he stumbles across a bag carrying a bomb. While law enforcement and the media praised him as a ""hero"" at first, the FBI begins to aggressively investigate the life of Richard Jewell as he becomes their number one suspect.DIRECTION:
Clint Eastwood is great. I love him as a director and as an actor in most things I've seen with him, although I struggle to feel he did something no other Director could do. I'm really glad he chose this this story to put out to the world and whether it's purposeful or not, adding his name to this project will bring this story to more people. I don't want to give him too hard of a time though, because this isn't a film meant to focus around the direction. The story/writing of this film is the focal point and he still did a very good job getting it done. To add one negative I took away, there was a moment where an interview with the real Richard Jewell played on the television as his house and it through me off a bit.WRITING:
The writing in this film was very good. It is based on a true story, so the story itself is largely what captured my attention. However, there are many movies based on or inspired by true stories where the writing couldn't really capture the heart of it and that is where the beauty of the writing lies. It's always hard to know exactly how everything went down and so whether this film is very accurate or mildly accurate, I'm glad they really focused on Richard Jewell and how it affected him and his family and how he was a real trooper through this whole process. There were a couple flaws that I did find with this film. There seemed to be some arc they were going for with Olivia Wilde's character that didn't really come to a close. Then with Tom Shaw (Jon Hamm) and Watson Bryant (Sam Rockwell), although their characters didn't have an arc to really be made with them, both of their parts ended quite abruptly. They were both vital to the story and the film didn't show me nor tell me anything about how either of those two continued after the fact. Well, there was a little info given about something Watson did, but nothing to do with Richard Jewell or his law firm that he had started (not a spoiler, was nothing integral to the story).ACTING:
The acting is so good in this film. I can't say it's Hamm's best nor does Wilde really get a chance to fulfill the arc of her character due to the writing, but none-the-less great actors. Then you have Kathy Bates and holy crap does she deserve a Best Supporting nom. All I hear is ""of course she's great, she's Kathy Bates)... AND? I'm sorry I didn't know that when you're consistently great that you should be penalized for it or receive any less attention. I get we come to expect it, but then what's the incentive to give your all if you'll just be tossed to the side, because of your positive reputation. That's totally backwards to me. Then Nina Arianda who played Nadya was awesome! She didn't have many scenes, but her back and forth with Sam Rockwell was hilarious and wonderful. Now, lets get to Paul Walter Hauser. Wow. I'm sorry, but this man is neck-and-neck with Adam Driver for me. He has not even been nominated for a Golden Globe or SAG Award? Did they even watch the film? I mean Sam Rockwell was great in this film too, but he's another one of those ""yea, but he's too good to nominate. Wouldn't be fare."" Paul Walter Hauser shows so much emotion and is SO good at being a man who is holding in his anger, because he respects law enforcement too much. Then in the scenes where he breaks are just tremendous. I will be sorely disappointed if he is not nominated this year.CONCLUSION:
Richard Jewell is a great story about one of American's greatest heroes who probably didn't get enough praise for the job that he did. The story itself and Paul Walter Hauser was enough for me to really enjoy this film, unfortunately there were some flaws with the story with some of the characters and some of the writing. In the end, I would definitely recommend this film for anyone to watch. Richard Jewell is the nicest man I have never met and this is just another story to show that doesn't matter how kind and genuine you are, you'll always have someone try to tear you down.",Richard Jewell,2019-12-13,7.5,66370,2019
tt3513548,8,"Eastwood has done it again, adding yet another wonderful film to what is a beyond legendary filmography. Based on the real-life story of a heroic security guard turned villain during the '66 Centennial Olympic Park bombing, we see the horrifying extent to which the media can vilify an individual, especially one as kind-hearted as Richard Jewell. So many incredible performances but Paul Walter Hauser... man oh man... his portrayal of the titular man is as deeply affecting and human as anything I've seen this year. Incredible stuff!",Richard Jewell,2019-12-13,7.5,66370,2019

kathy bates also played her part well, she did at times though come across with a slight tinge of over acting.

tt3513548,10,"Today's media, with its harsh criticism of this film, has suppressed the opening weekend box office of this very fine movie. After watching Richard Jewell, I can see why the print and television outlets don't want this movie seen by too many viewers.It wasn't just the Atlanta-Journal Constitution, the paper the broke the story of the FBI's interest in Mr. Jewell, but CNN, NBC, the New York Times and a host of other news outlets were complicit in crucifying an innocent security guard who spotted the explosive backpack. Director Clint Eastwood meticulously goes through each step of how the FBI's rush to judgement and its supporting media cast ruined the reputation of the hero who saved hundreds of lives from a terrorist action and portrayed him as suspect number one.The film's impact is further magnified by the media's actions today. Members who write and spout unproven accusations, provided by gov't agencies, should have learned important lessons from the Atlanta Summer Olympics episode. But sadly, they hadn't, and will continue its barbaric habits. A must see movie!",Richard Jewell,2019-12-13,7.5,66370,2019
tt3513548,8,"Richard Jewell is a great story, a tragedy that needed to be told. It is a shameful episode of both media hysteria and the excesses of inept law enforcement and abuse of an accused citizen. In this story, the media is shown rushing to judgement and convicting an innocent person in the press and on TV, a person who is ignorant of the power of the press, and the power that the FBI has to crush persons who are accused or suspected of crimes. The FBI repeatedly ignores the rights of the accused and tries to trick Jewell into confessing without meaning to, with blatant disregard for both ethics and the law itself. The corrosion that was so pervasive in 1996 is still there- and has grown to immense proportions.
The other element to this story, the lack of care taken by the news media is also relevant today. In this story the reporter who wrote the story naming Jewell as the main suspect eventually discovered the truth and attempted to correct the error as best she could unlike today- the media are dangerously taking sides on political issues rather than reporting or doing the job of a journalist. This is destroying trust of the media as surely as the politicization of the FBI and Justice Department will destroy the faith in the Federal government itself. Mr. Eastwood's film is sounding an alarm. Will anyone listen ?",Richard Jewell,2019-12-13,7.5,66370,2019
tt3513548,8,"""Richard Jewell"" (2019 release; 125 min.) brings the story of the suspected 1996 Atlanta bomber. As the movie opens, it is ""1986 Atlanta"" and Jewell is working as a supply room manager in a small law firm. He gets to know one of the lawyers,, Watson Bryant. We then go to ""1996 Piedmont College"" where Jewell is working as a security officer but he really sees himself as a law enforcer. Eventually, just months before the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, he is fired by Piedmont's President... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from director/producer Client Eastwood. Here he brings the story of Richard Jewell, whom you may recall was a security officer at Atlanta's Centennial Park the night a bomb attack killed 2 and wounded many more. For reasons the movie reveals in great details (but I don't want to spoil for you), Jewell becomes a ""person of interest"" and the frantic media jump on the story. It is frankly incredibly frightening when you put it all into context and see how a man's life gets mauled. Per the usual, Eastwood does a great job to keep the movie going forward. The all- star ensemble cast is incredible: Paul Walter Hauser IS Richard Jewell, and Sam Rockwell, Kathy Bates, Jon Hamm and Olivia Wilde are equally outstanding. This movie was filmed in the Spring of this year, and now barely 6 months later, it is already in theaters.""Richard Jewell"" premiered wide this weekend, and I couldn't wait to see it. The Saturday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended dismally (4 people exactly), much to my surprise. If you have any interest to see how the 1996 Atlanta bombing played out, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",Richard Jewell,2019-12-13,7.5,66370,2019
tt3513548,10,"This is a movie that tells about the dangers of reckless journalism. Journalists plays a very important role in a free democratic society however, they must act with integrity, utmost diligence and caution because they can destroy people lives when they write recklessly, this is what happened to Richard Jewell.",Richard Jewell,2019-12-13,7.5,66370,2019
tt3513548,9,"First Hit: Outstanding film and portrayal of a man who went through hell because of the FBI and the malfeasance of a newspaper reporter.I so bought into Richard Jewell's character as portrayed by Paul Walter Hauser. He was terrific and gave me a real sense of a man who really tried hard to follow the rule of law and be someone people could count on to protect them.This is based on a true story about Richard Jewell, who was pretty much a loner, lived with his mother Bobi (Kathy Bates), and wanted to be part of the law enforcement community all his life.When we first engage with Jewell, he's a supply clerk in a company and we see that he is thoughtful and careful about his work. We are shown this as he overhears a loud, aggressive telephone conversation by Watson Bryant (Sam Rockwell) and a client of the company they work for.Apologizing for overhearing the conversation (there's no way he couldn't hear), he tells Watson to look in a drawer because Jewell has filled it with the pens Watson uses in his work. Also, asking Bryant to open another drawer, it is filled with Snickers candy bars, the snack food Bryant eats when stressed.Through this interchange, hey become acquaintances and chat from time to time. One day Jewell gets a job offer to be a security guard at a local college campus. Saying goodbye to Bryant is very sweet. Bryant caught off guard, gives him a $100 bill in case he might need anything during the transition between jobs. Jewell is touched, and for him, their friendship is now rock-solid.At his new job, he has a run-in with some students who are breaking campus rules and he gets fired for this and because he's overstepping his bounds by stopping cars on the highway near the campus looking for drugs.These things highlight a couple of things about Jewell, he believes in following the rules, and he can and will step outside the bounds of his authority.Getting a job as a security guard for AT&T at their sponsorship of events at Centennial Park as part of the celebrations for the 1996 Atlanta Olympics in Atlanta, GA. His thoughtfulness and kindness are highlighted here, as well. Providing water or Coca Cola to pregnant women so that they do not become dehydrated, and he also supplies the lighting and filming crew in the nearby tower with food or other things they need. He wants to be helpful.He's also looking for suspicious items and people. When he discovers a backpack that has been left under a bench where he was sitting, he tells the police. The police team brings in some experts and they realize it is a bomb. While moving the crowd back, the bomb explodes, and two people are killed, and many others are injured.At first, he's seen as a hero and is on television. He's proud of his work, and his mother is especially pleased because her favorite newscaster, Tom Brokaw, spoke glowingly about her son.FBI Agent Tom Shaw (Jon Hamm) was also stationed at the park and is disappointed that he was stationed there, and even worse, something happened on his watch, and he didn't prevent it. After interviewing Jewell's past records and after meeting with the college who fired Jewell, Richard becomes a suspect. What does Jewell do when he realizes the FBI is considering him a suspect, he calls Bryant.Local newspaper columnist Kathy Scruggs (Olivia Wilde), who only wants to make a name for herself, uses her sexuality towards Shaw to extract this FBI probe about Jewell. She writes an unconfirmed expose front-page article in the newspaper, and in a New York minute, it jumps up to become national headlines.Now Jewell is seen as the vilified criminal, not the hero, all in a span of about a week.The film then tells the story of how his friendship with Bryant and the undying support of his mom, and longtime friend Brandon Walker (Mike Pniewski) help him through the onslaught of the rush to judgment people - the FBI and Media.I did find it interesting that this film has come out when both the FBI and the Media are under a public spotlight and scrutiny.Hauser needs to receive an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Jewell. He was terrific in bringing this confused, caring man to life. His sincerity, thoughtfulness, and helpfulness (even at the wrong times) are excellently portrayed. Rockwell gives yet another robust and stunning performance as Jewell's friend and attorney. His sarcasm and pointed jabs at the FBI's flawed work were excellent. Hamm was good, but it would be nice to see him in a role where drinking and sex are not his only motivation. Wilde was all over the place and enjoyable as Scruggs, who clearly had only one thing on her mind, fame. Bates was terrific as Jewell's mother. Her demonstration of faith in her son and that he wasn't who people were making him out to be, was sublime. Nina Arlanda, as Watson Bryant's office manager and friend, Nadya Light, brought a beautiful blend of humor and persistence to Bryant's actions. Billy Ray wrote an outstanding screenplay that was crisp and painted each character entirely. Clint Eastwood did an excellent job of directing this story. He is usually efficient in telling stories and here he stepped it up a notch.Overall: This was a wonderfully entertaining film and brought to life a story I read about some twenty-three years ago.",Richard Jewell,2019-12-13,7.5,66370,2019

Now the news is in the business of reporting what will give them the highest rating instead of primary purpose: keep a free people informed. I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this story.

tt3513548,10,"I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE! We are all Richard Jewell. When a once storied agency can abuse it's power and take away all due process rights afforded in the Constitution, we all in grave danger. I once thought that the corruption in the FBI was limited to a few corrupt execs at the top, Jewell proves that is not the case. The program I work in is being scrapped and rebuilt as it is not very efficient. The FBI is not only totally inefficient, they are actively working to frame the innocent and destroy people's lives. FBI has lost all credibility. They knew that the entrapment they set up against an uncouth Jewell would make him a perfect patsy. The FBI had no concern of finding the actual bomb maker, they put all their energy to violating due process rights, and continued to harass a hero when they knew they he was innocent. The FBI needs to be scraped and rebuilt as an investigative agency that protects, serves and follows the Constitution.The media also needs to be held accountable for destroying the lives of innocent people. Jewell settled out of court with Tom Brokaw and NBC. Brokaw shamelessly said this, ""They probably have enough to arrest him right now, probably enough to prosecute him, but you always want to have enough to convict him as well."" Having read 'Unfreedom OF The Press' by Mark Levin, this movie substantiates everything in that book.All the actors gave passionate career performances beyond my wildest expectations. Given that, Paul Walter Hauser as Richard Jewell gave one of the best performances I have ever seen. I was totally immersed in his role. He was me, my neighbor, the security guard at my job who works tirelessly to keep me and my colleagues safe.

This is based on decades of documented and well known civll and criminal cases, countless deaths, DuPont's own records they tried to hide, and on and on.

Since the name is not advertised in the previews, I won't spoil it here ... but everyone has heard of it and ... ugh ... been somewhat contaminated by it.This is not really an ""action"" movie ... it's a bit of a slow-burn as developments take place over stretches of time.

tt9071322,9,"There's nothing here that you have not seen. Go ahead and call it ""Aaron Brockovich."" But director Todd Haynes still makes it entirely engaging and painfully true that death is a number compared to liability and that is how you can sustain cold hearted industry. Made more gut wrenching is how they believed the ends justified the means.
Mark Ruffalo tackles the lawyer with the conscience wonderfully. Suffering under the weight of what he must do and what then envelops his small world. It's heroic in how much he does sacrifice and let's face it, these stories don't end well. What director Haynes does is put a face to the not-on-the-books crime. And though, it only is a civil case somehow you sense the frustration of the town. Not played as rubes but believing that a massive corporation who funded and gave perks to sustain the village wouldn't willingly destroy it. As we know now versus 1998, they knew...if not for simple morbid curiosity. Then sat on the information as it fed the machine decades later, we are now more informed and much more paranoid. Everything we eat or touch or...breathe we are closer to death.
I was in that area in 1998...and the news then spent less time on it then I recall. As a college bound student, I heard murmurs of DuPont and jokes were made of this. Now...it seems bitterly grim. How many lives were destroyed because of shady dealings. When you peel the onion, you do weep.
I love this flick. The flavor of that era is pitch perfect. The backroads of an industrial town, built under poor chemistry just sweats disease. And you walk out angered by it. The fight continues to this day.",Dark Waters,2019-12-06,7.6,64254,2019

tt9071322,10,"I don't pretend this is the best film of 2019, but it is likely the most important - a real must-see for people of all political persuasions (and anybody seriously considering going to law school). And you'll see how the most dangerous lawyer is the one who switches sides from defending the polluters to protecting their victims.Dark Waters accurately portrays ""the swamp"" that so many politicians rant against, but few rarely do anything to mitigate. The failures of the EPA and Congress -- all due largely to the Republicans who for some reason feel that it's okay for industry to poison the American people as long as it's profitable -- are stunning. You will learn how DuPont has been willfully poisoning us with Teflon coatings which it knew were carcinogenic way back in the 1970s. You'll see how DuPont issued a death sentence to its own employees as well as the residents of Parkersburg, WV with the waste from its manufacturing plant.As an attorney, I can attest that this is the one film that really shows how demanding law can be - the seemingly never-ending, exhausting effort needed to bring DuPont to some semblence of justice. And you'll witness how at a law firm's partners meeting, the partners who haven't even read the briefs dump on the case out of their ignorance and arrogance. Fortunately, in this instance those fools did not prevail. Otherwise we'd all still be cooking on Teflon-coated pans which, when hot enough, produce the carcinogens that have caused countless cancers and deaths throughout the world.If this film doesn't get you angry and determined to vote out of office the politicians who are eviscerating environmental protections, nothing will. It was a chilling reminder the morning after we saw Dark Waters that the headlines reported that the Trump administration was seeking to relax restrictions on deadly ethylene oxides -- in response to lobbying by the same good folks that have been poisoning us for decades.

tt9071322,9,"In terms of storytelling, Dark Waters' most close associate that I've seen is The Big Short. Tonally, these two are polar opposites, but they both illustrate their convoluted and complicated stories of corporate corruption well. Well enough for any non-chemist, non-lawyer, non-doctor to understand the injustice that corporate overlords have exacted upon the public.The film is constantly tearing down the spirit of Mark Ruffalo, followed by brief, hopeful moments that Dupont will be held accountable for poisoning tens of thousands of people. These hopeful and demoralizing notes begin small. The idea that the EPA will help Wilbur Tenant, the farmer who had his cattle herd die from poisoned drinking water, is followed by Ruffalo realizing that report was written in part by Dupont scientists who will, of course, be corrupt. And that demoralizing note is followed by bestowing the hope that Wilbur Tenant will finally get his long sought chance for a $ settlement, and that's followed by the soul crushing scene of his entire family drinking water out of the tap, still poisoning themselves with no other means to change their fate.That was the scene that made me cry with rage. That nothing could be done to escape their death. What could they do without water? They're thirsty, and stressed, and their kids just want to come home from school and live normal lives. All I could do was cry tears of rage. Wilbur was not being served justice.The notes continue swooping from high to low. Ruffalo is served mountains of paperwork during the lawsuit against Dupont. Like, a laughable amount that no one could ever finish reviewing. But he sets to work anyway and finds the smoking gun: Dupont has known about the poison for decades. The film makes the audience believe we have Dupont dead to rights, but they wiggle out of it with legal maneuvering. When it has been years after the public blood testing, and no answers are given as to whether Dupont is at fault, the public gets angry at Ruffalo. All this pressure builds into him having a mental breakdown/siezure, and we all feared he would quit. Then, after he recovers, the call finally comes from the science panel that he was right. Dupont absolutely poisoned these people and must pay for their health damage. This movie is like an emotionally abusive boyfriend.Finally, we won, right? No. Dupont rips up the mediation contract (one would think this illegal) and now says anyone who has health problems cannot take part in a class action lawsuit, but can do so individually.And that's when we finally leave on the highest of high notes that makes you curse with joy and unleash primal, guttural screams of victory: Mark Ruffalo starts representing each of those West Virginians individually, wins tens of millions of dollars in the first 3 cases, and DUPONT GIVES UP. THEY PAYOUT THE BETTER PART OF A BILLION DOLLARS. WHOOOOOOOOOOOOO YEAAAH SUCK IT.",Dark Waters,2019-12-06,7.6,64254,2019
tt9071322,8,"First Hit: An excellent portrayal of corporate malfeasance and arrogance, finally getting its comeuppance.Robert Bilott (Mark Ruffalo), a corporate attorney, is a thorough pragmatic defender of corporations. He's just made partner in his firm and is a powerful asset to the company because he's so good at his work.During an important meeting, he's interrupted by Wilber Tennent (Bill Camp) and friend who come from a farm in Parkersburg, West Virginia. They come to see Bilott because Roberts's grandmother, ""Grammy,"" is a friend of Tennent.
They hand Bilott a box full of videotapes explaining that no local Parkersburg lawyer will help them with the problem of their cattle dying. They believe the animals are dying because the town's largest employer, Dupont, is polluting the water with chemicals from their facility.Bilott tries to deter Tennent and not get involved, but Tennent's plea knags at him, so he visits his Grammy, verifies she knows Tennent and then drives to Tennent's farm. When Wilbur shows him his field full of buried cows, ""190 of them,"" he realizes there is a problem.Although Bilott's firm doesn't have Dupont as a corporate client, they are reluctant to take on a nonpaying client that is going to end up suing Dupont as it will hurt their reputation with their own corporate clients.However, Tom Terp (Tim Robbins), Bilott's boss, supports Robert continuing his investigation even though his client cannot pay. There is a great scene when all the partners convene to hear and discuss Bilott's work.Finally, Dupont sends over all the discovery information that Bilott had requested, and it is massive. Hundreds of boxes of memos, reports, and other documentation. Being a team of one, dutifully Robert sits down on the floor and begins categorizing each document by year and subject. This is a great scene because it cements Robert's commitment to do the right thing no matter what it takes.His years of research comes up with proof that Dupont knew that they were poisoning people and animals through the creation, use of, and byproducts from POFA (C8), a chemical creation used in Teflon© the non-stick coating that everyone was using. C8 is one of those chemicals that cannot be broken down by nature, let alone the human body and therefore it stays in the body and slowly causes various types of cancer.The film takes us through this story as it develops over the years of difficult lonely hard work on Bilott's part. The filmmakers did a great job of showing the passage of time by giving the audience quick glimpse of his three boys growing up in front of him. He barely interacts with them because he's so clearly focused on this one case, this man is all in.In the meantime, because of the court's slow processes, Dupont's putting roadblocks at every turn, and the slowness of a medical testing company that was reviewing, over sixty thousand blood tests, people were continuing to be poisoned and die from being exposed to C8.We watch as the stress of doing the right thing for his client requires him to take reductions in pay because he's spending all his time on this case that has no paying client. We watch him feel the pain while watching his clients deteriorate because of the poison.His wife Sarah (Anne Hathaway) tries to keep their family together, showing undying support, even as she sees the deterioration of her husband because of the deeply committed compassion to see this lawsuit through for the people who are being harmed.One thing the film made sure of was the darkness of this subject. Every scene is dark in color or filled with gray skies.Ruffalo was excellent as the committed attorney who gave up almost everything, including his life, to find and fight for the truth. Hathaway was superb as his supportive wife attempting to keep their family together while Robert fights for the truth. Robbins was influential as Bilott's boss and senior managing partner of their law firm, showing support for Robert on this long trail to truth. Camp was terrific, and the driven farmer and rancher who committed his life to making sure Dupont was charged for their crimes against his community. Victor Garber, as Phil Donnelly, a senior executive in Dupont, was supreme in his portrayal of being the mouthpiece of corporate malfeasance. Mare Winningham, as Darlene Kiger, a Parkersburg resident, was fantastic. It was lovely to see her on the screen again. Mario Correa and Matthew Michael Carnahan wrote a powerfully detailed script. Todd Haynes did a great job of creating the feel corporate malfeasance and the difficulty of making wealthy companies pay for their crimes against humanity.Overall: This is an excellent story about the power of perseverance.",Dark Waters,2019-12-06,7.6,64254,2019

The fact that it is based on a true story in recent times is rather terrifying yet interesting at the same time, and makes you look at some of our Western products in a different way.

It is very well thought out and almost takes you by surprise ... because it treats the viewer as intelligently as it handles the subject matter. It is the obvious parts of the story that are shocking ... the power of the corporation ... the government needing to be pushed into doing what it was elected to do and the disregard for public safety by all concerned. The lies, the money, the complicit behavior of those perpetrating what is represented as criminal behavior, which is what the movie hints at.

tt9071322,8,"""Dark Waters"" (2019 release; 126 min.) brings the story of Cincinnati lawyer Rob Bilott's long legal battle against DuPont. As the movie opens, it is ""1975 Parkersburg, West Virginia"" as we see several teenagers (one of them a young Bilott) go swimming in a lake that we later see being sprayed with chemicals. We then go to ""1998 Cincinnati, Ohio"", and Rob has just made partner at Taft, one of the large law firms in Cincinnati. Then a stranger shows up who is from Parkersburg and knows Rob's grandmother. The stranger, Wilbur Tennant, claims that chemicals have ruined his farm, he has the VHS tapes to prove it, and can Rob please represent him.... At this point we're 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all turns out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from Todd Haynes, whose prior movie, the excellent ""Carol"" was coincidentally also filmed here in Cincinnati (where I live). But that is where the comparisons stop. Here, Haynes brings to the big screen the long legal battle that Bilott fought against chemical giant DuPont. The film starts a bit tentative in my opinion, but after the first half hour, the tension doesn't let up as DuPont is fighting with all of its might against Bilott. This movie is a labor of love for Mark Ruffalo, who stars and also co-produces. I've seen a lot of the films that Ruffalo has made in his career, and I don't know that he's ever been better, playing the almost mousy yet determined lawyer. Anne Hathaway seems underused as the supportive spouse but as the movie goes deeper, her role expands. The movie was filmed in early 2019 in and around Cincinnati, and the downtown area is featured extensively, including Fountain Square, the Queen City Club, the Hall of Mirrors at the Netherland Plaza, etc.The movie had a red carpet premiere here in Cincinnati in mid-November, a week before it got a limited theater release. This weekend it got a wide release, and the Friday early evening screening where I saw it at my art-house theater here in Cincinnati was attended okay (about 20 people). This movie will surely create strong word of mouth, and if it manages to pick up some award nominations (as it is expected), this could have a decent run in the theaters. If you are interested in a tense legal drama where Mark Ruffalo shines, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray.",Dark Waters,2019-12-06,7.6,64254,2019

tt9071322,8,"Hayne's 'Dark Waters' is an unsettling, slow-drip legal thriller about large companies and the people who become its collateral damage..it is absolutely real and intricately crafted to show the conspiracies ongoing among these big organizations.Mark Ruffalo plays the character of a corporate defense attorney who switched side to fight for the people who are the victims of poisoning caused by the company..and he had done a sensational job just like Foxcatcher, Spotlight if not best..Anne Hathaway though her character was secondary but she was also great.Moreover, this movie is compelling, informative and it feels more realistic and true than any other this type of movie.Though movie is about a serious issue, it keeps you engaged till the last. However 'Dark Waters' delivers both justice and a crushing sense of dread..and if you like Spotlight, The Post etc. then you definitely should watch it.",Dark Waters,2019-12-06,7.6,64254,2019
tt9071322,10,"In recent decades, particularly since the horror that erupted on 9/11, more than a few dramatic movies have dealt with real-life events and/or social issues in ways that are often so engaging that they supersede most Hollywood blockbusters. Some of the very best deal with the kind of rampant corporate malfeasance that goes on when there are few or no regulations in place to protect the people that these corporations have a tendency to harm with all-too-painful regularity. DARK WATERS is one of those films.Mark Ruffalo portrays Robert Billott, a Cincinnati-based attorney who is part of a law firm that represents dozens of multi-billion dollar corporations, the biggest not only in America but the world at large as well. But when he hears about a farmer in his own hometown of Parkersburg, West Virginia who has lost nearly two hundred head of cows because they drank from toxically polluted water, he wades into the situation (albeit reluctantly at first) and discovers that one of the companies he has represented in his time, no less than DuPont, is the corporation whose dumping of their toxic waste is responsible for not having only killed livestock, but poisoning and/or severely deforming almost everybody there in Parkersburg, nearly seventy thousand in all. Combing through documents dating all the way back to the 1970s, he learns that some of this poisoning may be connected to a very well-known product, that DuPont created back in the early 1960s (everyone will know all too well what the name of that product is), and is in practically everything in every home in the United States, including pots and pans. The toll it took on him and his family, including the relationship with his wife (portrayed by Anne Hathaway) was almost too much for him (he ended up in the hospital for a time); but he kept on fighting for the people in his town, getting blood samples from everyone tested to be used as evidence of DuPont's corporate malfeasance, which virtually bordered on corporate homicide.Based on Nathaniel Rich's article ""The Lawyer Who Became DuPont's Worst Nightmare"" that appeared in the New York Times Magazine in 2016, DARK WATERS is quite well directed by Todd Haynes (I'M NOT THERE; WONDERSTRUCK), and co-written by Matthew Michael Carnahan (LIONS FOR LAMBS; DEEPWATER HORIZON). Ruffalo, who portrayed one of the Boston Globe reporters in the much-acclaimed 2015 drama SPOTLIGHT, ably portrays Billott in a way that gives us a glimpse into his way of thinking that, just by having represented DuPont in his time, he himself may have been somewhat responsible for the years-long poisoning of his own hometown, even if only indirectly. The atmosphere conjured up by Haynes is not too dissimilar to what we saw in ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN, SPOTLIGHT, or THE POST, one that is decidedly sinister, shadowy and arguably corrupting. Tim Robbins, well known for his highly liberal political beliefs, does a good job of playing Ruffalo's partner in the firm, who is initially extremely reluctant to take his side but then does when the facts about DuPont become too big to ignore. Mare Winningham is also good as one of Parkersburg's many residents who have to face what the town's biggest employer has been doing to then for decades.While it may seem all too common for movies to take what may seem like potshots at multi-billion dollar conglomerates, when they do the wrong thing (which seems to happen all too frequently, as it did with DuPont), then those wrongs have to have a light shone on them. This is what DARK WATERS does; and as a result, it was one of the best films released in 2019.",Dark Waters,2019-12-06,7.6,64254,2019

It was only when I came on here that I learned this was supposed to be set in the 80's?! Well, you could have fooled me. Perfect cameras and remarkable surveillance footage were obviously available in Russia at that time. This has been done a million times but in the case of Hanna, was done a million times better.

Besson's issue is that we continues to make the same film over and over again but with slightly alternate storyline. It's old, been done before and ultimately boring. Who's the star of this film?

However, Nikita, Leon also Subway, Big Blue, Fifth Element are among my all time favorite films. Also ""Taken"" character is a creation of Besson! He is very original, a real European prodigy.Anna is a kind of 2019 remake of La Femme Nikita-(1990) with a new and original face (Sasha Luss) who does a decent job of fooling the viewer into different roads during the film. She has a female poker face and smile. I think Besson noticed her ability to deceive viewers earlier in her motion capture role during Valerian (2017) shooting and decided to remake Nikita with her. (Did he also fall in love with her as happened before with Anne Parillaud and Milla Jovovich? I am curious.)Some younger viewers may have a problem with the action scenes: A female lead doing fast action scenes is not so original they would say: Atomic Blonde and Kill Bill for example, had them. However, my younger viewer friends should know that these films owe big time to Nikita and Leon. Maybe for that reason, in Anna, Besson makes fun of both Atomic Blonde and Kill Bill! Her black leather fight costume is a salute to Atomic Blonde and tens of black suited body guards that she kills in a restaurant is a smile to Tarantino. The earliest female hitman, sorry, hitperson was Nikita! She was a very big shock to viewers in 1990 (I had watched it also on the first day). So was Leon. Americans almost couldn't watch that great film due to censorship.Anna the character is: 60% Nikita, 20% Leeloo of Fifth Element and 20% Leon's girl. Character Alex is = 100% Bob (of Nikita).I recommend everyone to go and see Luc Besson's latest ideas and without giving away spoilers it is impossible to write more about this film.

We follow her through scattered time and location jumps that push her through to the end of the film but at no point does the film introduce any personality or meaningful character traits besides the fact that she is good looking. She even at a point becomes a very unlikeable character that's difficult to get behind for the remainder of the story. Her important relationships (if you can call them that) are never actually given proper development besides a line or short sex montage to suggest they've grown close offscreen. What little action there is (two sequences) is bland and boring. Also, the film wastes Helen Mirren and Cillian Murphy. In the end this one is overlong, unfocused and follows an utterly charmless (besides being a great beauty) protagonist through a barebones plot and it lacks the fun and style you want from a proper spy/action film.

The visualization of the various horror figures, e.g. Harold and the Pale Lady.Several creepy and/or shocking moments keep things interesting, e.g. the pimple scene.Zoe Colletti as Stella was fun to watch.Lowlights:
The 'outer story' constructed to wrap the stories together is lazy and uninspired. It would have been better just to leave them separate and flesh them out a little, drawing out the tension in each.I liked the attempt to bring in the 1968/Nixon/Vietnam stuff, but it just came across as awkward.The characters are all pretty stock, giving the film a packaged feeling.The scene with Stella and Sarah towards the end is in particular forced and weak (""that's on you"" ...ugh, an eight year old could have written this)Overall comes across as pretty standard stuff. It's not horrible, but it could have been much better.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark,2019-08-09,6.2,62240,2019
tt3387520,7,"In small town America 1968, there is a dark history that hangs over an old abandoned house regarding the fate of the Bellows family. While escaping the town bullies, a group of teenagers break into the house to hide and it is in this house they find a dusty old book full of terrifying stories but as they take it away with them, new stories begin to appear in the book and the group of friends start to disappear one by one. When I first saw this advertised, I had never heard of the books on which it is based and from the trailer I couldn't figure out who the audience for this story might be. From the trailer I felt it was aimed at young teenagers but then some of the imagery used on screen seemed so terrifying and disturbing i thought it couldn't possibly be. Well it turns out it is aimed at teenagers and if i was a teenager watching this i would probably have loved it. As an adult i did still enjoy it, the horror elements were done brilliantly, scary, disturbing and memorable. It's the bits in between the horror that let it down slightly. I just felt the characters weren't developed enough and didn't really gel together like the young cast of IT did. Visually impressive and a decent story behind it but could have done with some extra time dedicated to character development.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark,2019-08-09,6.2,62240,2019
tt3387520,9,This movie was surprisingly spooky and creepy. Sure there were some simple goofs but overall the story moved at a good pace. My husband and I grew up reading the books and were excited to see how they were going to make all those short stories into an actual movie and we were not dissapointed. I love horror films and I thought this movie was going to be some kiddie spooky movie but my husband said he just might have nightmares from watching it late at night.,Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark,2019-08-09,6.2,62240,2019
tt3387520,8,"While this film doesn't break any new ground or add innovation to the horror genre necessarily, it brings the stories we grew up with to life and gives them a richer visual identity. Ovredal/Del Toro excel at giving us chillingly well constructed tension filled scenes of ominous creatures, haunting spirits, and just an atmospheric overall feel that puts the viewer right into the stories. While the teen characters are by the numbers and wreak of goosebumps/IT/Stranger Things influence, they are serviceable for the particular story. The horror visuals take the main focus and steal the show for the 108min runtime which is actually longer than most horror's of this nature and build off scene to scene effectively. Even viewers that are unfamiliar with the classic stories of the same name will be very satisfied with this film and hopefully be inspired to go back and read the books. I hope this film spawns a franchise and I'm happy to say this thoroughly surprised me as i was cautiously optimistic as to how they'd adapt it.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark,2019-08-09,6.2,62240,2019
tt3387520,7,"To my surprise, this movie was not what I was expecting at all. From the title, I was sure I'd see a portmanteau movie of unconnected short stories, similar to 1983's ""Twilight Zone: The Movie"". But with a kid-centric plot and set in a small American town, the formula is similar to ""It"" or ""Super 8"". However, the episodic nature of serial ""incidents"" aligns it more with the style of the ""Final Destination"" films.Stella Nicholls (Zoe Margaret Colletti) is a horror geek and aspiring writer living in Mill Valley, a small Pennsylvanian town during the Nixon election of 1968. Stella has a couple of friends: the requisite Scoobie Doo Shaggy character Chuck (Austin Zajur) and the 'sensible' ""it's all science"" character Auggie (Gabriel Rush). But pursued by local hoodlum Tommy (Austin Abrams), Stella, Chuck and Auggie are thrown together with draft-dodging outsider Ramón (Michael Garza).They escape into the local spooky house - a house where legend has it that terrible things were done to a strange albini girl, Sarah. That legend has it that Sarah used to tell local kids scary stories through the walls. And Stella finds a book... a book that appears to be unfinished....This is a time when horror films are either ""old school"" or more psychological in nature (like ""Hereditary""). This one has Guillermo del Toro's hand behind that of lead-writers Dan and Kevin Hagerman. And it's firmly old-school. There are some effective (but at times comically created) spooky moments that are scary without being hugely gory. This earns it a UK15, rather than a UK18, certificate. It's disappointing that doesn't stretch to 12A to attract a younger teenage audience, since the source material is actually from a ""Goosebumps""-like set of short stories by Alvin Schwartz.The story's 'episodes' are nicely varied. At the gross-out end of the scale is an episode with Chuck's sister Ruth (Natalie Ganzhorn) that might get arachnophobes running for the exits. My personal favourite? A 'red room' episode with the oncoming fate comically arriving in slow-motion like the steam-roller in ""Austin Powers""!This is another film that relies on the quality of its young cast, with the only moderately well-know cast name being Gil Bellows as the local sheriff. In this regard, the stand-out performance is that of Zoe Margaret Colletti who does a fabulous job as Stella. She's been in a few films in the past (""Annie"", ""Wildlife"" and ""Skin"") but this is her breakout performance in a starring role. She's done her CV a great favour here.Directed by ""Troll Hunter"" director André Øvredal, I really enjoyed this one. I'm not a massive fan of 'slasher' style horror films. I have no burning desire to be constantly reminded of what the inside of my body looks like. So this turned out to be much-more to my liking than the normal horror flick. It had enough spookiness to make me turn on the lights when I got back home, but not enough to pervade my dreams.The young cast perform well. They are given enough back-story and personality by the script to make you care about their fate.So overall, this one comes with a ""Recommended for wimps"" (like me)!(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on t'interweb or Facebook.

tt3387520,7,"While this movie may have had a few of your typical horror movies moments, it is still an interesting concept. The actors all for the most part play their roles well, and the special effects and cgi are all there. I could see this film gain a cult following and maybe end up having a trilogy or even more movies. The fact that this movie doesn't have a lot of star power is another reason why I enjoyed it. I like seeing young, up and coming actors shine new light into a genre that is seldom successful at actually making a good and enjoyable film.

tt3387520,7,"Good: The main story that is tying the 'scary stories' together is interesting and a fresh take as the 'scary stories' are short and filler needs to be made for a feature film. The direction from Øvredal is great finding the right amount of scares to be had with built suspense from the grisly production by Del Toro.Bad: The cast is fine, nothing spectacular or atrocious, it is something you would expect from a horror film. Some lines are cheesy and laughable. The main story could have been shortened.Overall: Although there is nothing innovating it is still a solid fresh straight-up(less jump scare, more imagery) horror of 2019 that can pass the time with entertainment and chills to be made.3.5/5",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark,2019-08-09,6.2,62240,2019
tt3387520,4,"I was a bit skeptical about how the trailers for this looked, but I decided to see it anyway because Guillermo del Toro was producing (who I love.) I have not read the book on which it is based. Unfortunately, the film was a mess, and I'm honestly pretty surprised that Del Toro attached his name to this, even though he's not directing this time.The film tells the story of a group of teenagers who enter a haunted house on Halloween, and end up reading a book of scary stories that comes to life. Unfortunately, far too much of virtually all of the stories are revealed in the film's trailers, which reduces the impact of them on the viewer. Additionally, most of them except the ""Jangly Man"" story at the end are too short to really have a real impact on the viewer. Unlike other Del Toro-credited efforts in the horror genre, like the Gothic horror film ""Crimson Peak,"" this movie overloads itself with loud and obnoxious jump-scares, which is one of the laziest tropes in modern horror movies. There's no genuine suspense or dread building. The script is generally rather weak, and the characters are underdeveloped. The writers try some attempt at social commentary by making some parallels to some of Richard Nixon's worst instincts (the story is set in 1968) to try to highlight similarities between Nixon and Trump. Unfortunately, however, this attempt at social commentary feels too forced, unlike in (for example) Jordan Peele's films where the social commentary is both subtle-at-times yet strikingly genuine. I will give Del Toro credit for making visually interesting creatures/monsters in the stories, as we can always expect from him. But otherwise, this film ends up being a misfire. It's also not clear who its target audience is, as it's too scary for children but too childish for most teen and adult viewers. Not recommended. 4/10",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark,2019-08-09,6.2,62240,2019

The movie is good if you're looking for some really corny popcorn flick, and maybe have a few laughs. I was just disappointed, I guess I had expected too much from a film that at the time I didn't realize was PG-13, it was a Guillermo Del Toro film.
The same director who had directed Shape of Water (2017) which had won several nominations. Hellboy (2004), Pan's Labyrinth (2006), Hellboy: The Golden Army (2008), and Pacific Rim (2013)
So many great movies from such an amazingly unique director!
Even though I was disappointed for how easily forgettable the movie could be, it had very little CGI, only 10% of CGI was used for the monster's while the majority 90% was practical effects, so good job for the special effects team.

People who scare easily will like it too.They did a wonderful job getting the ""scary"" characters to look exactly how they were illustrated. In the books none of the stories are connected. Here, a main story was created to connect them. It's actually not that bad. It's scarier and less cheesy than what passes as children's horror but it's not like what adults expect.

tt3387520,2,"I am a lifelong horror fan and a child of the '80s. I grew up with these books, and they hold a special place in my heart. I should have listened to my heart when it told me that this film never should have been made so I am mad at myself for paying to see it. I guess this is on me, because, alas I did.Having said that, I must say that I am speechless at how bad this film was. The original books left so much to the imagination but this film version has none and leaves no room for audiences to use theirs. Yes, I know it's a ""PG-13 horror film"", but there are countless PG and PG-13 horror films that are excellent examples of the genre and outshine this wretched mess on every conceivable level: ""Poltergeist"" ""The Gate"", The ""Monster Squad"", from the '80s are a few examples if we are talking kid-friendly. ""Get Out"", 2002's Mothman Prophecies, and ""Insidious"" come to mind if we are citing more current PG-13. In fact, some of the scariest films ever made were PG (if you don't believe me, check out Disney's Watcher in the Woods from 1980 or 1980s The Changeling for starters).Technically the film is perfectly average. The musical score is recycled from every modern film of its type, cinematography stale, and the CGI effects out of place, as they undermine the books' old-fashioned sensibilities. Speaking of old-fashioned sensibilities, the film's depiction of small town America, especially 60's America, is hollow and inauthentic. Every authority figure and adult character is an unlikable stereotype, each lacking the warmth and innocence you would find in a small town during that time period. The main teen characters are all stock, lacking any semblance of charisma or nuance, and speak in distractingly modern-day colloquialisms. These are kids of today that act and talk like kids of today.The film's ultimate misstep is by creating a perfectly unnecessary narrative thread designed to link all the disparate stories together. This adds absolutely nothing to the proceedings and results in the majority of the main characters spending half the film's running time reading aloud from books ""searching for the answers"" to help them destroy-whatever is-never mind, it doesn't matter. If this was a mystery, that would be perfectly fine, -but it's a film based on one to two-page stories, intended to scare the living daylights out of its readers- and should have been presented strictly as an anthology (ala Creepshow). Scary Stories (stories and/or films) were meant to be visceral-to be experienced on a primal level-and I would expect a film based on famous books that did just that, to follow suit. Instead, Scary Stories seems more concerned with pandering solely to fans of ""Stranger Things"" and the ""It"" crowd.One last note: for a modern-day PG-13 horror film, Scary Stories is far more gruesome than all the aforementioned films of its type I cited earlier, while still managing to be infinitely less scary and well made.",Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark,2019-08-09,6.2,62240,2019

On certain aspects, in particular the ineluctably-fatalistic side, the film makes me think of A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) directed by Wes Craven in which a psychopath sadistically haunts teens during their sleep.After the showing of a cult film (Night of the Living Dead (1968)) in a drive-in theater, a group of teens arrives, we do not really know how, in a time-worn mansion on the edge of town, abandoned for ages after an unexplained murder. By chance, they find a book. A cursed book! The small town will then suffer a wave of atrocious deaths.

As a huge fan of André Øvredal (director of Trollhunter & Autopsy of Jane Doe), expected it bit more twisted & eerily creepy particularly around the different monster/entity encounters at different segments. Among the ghostly entities, The Jangly Man & The Pale Lady were the most interesting; and while they could have done more with The Pale Lady (looked like a creepy character from a Japanese manga), the intro to this character was kind of disappointing & somewhat same like Harold the Scarecrow. The Jangly Man was the most satisfactory one...wondering what James Wan would have do with it?! Speaking of Wan, at times it just came to my mind that considering the format & the stories...I think Wan or Mike Flanagan would have been a better choice for this film than Øvredal.It got potential to be more darker, scarier & entertaining but PG-13 approach turned out to be a let down for me.

I'm in my 30s, this movie isn't geared towards me, but hey, nostalgia plus teacher equals can I get kids to watch this and want to read more?Except... the movie is slow to start. The glue they tried to hold it together with wasn't necessarily bad, but it also wasn't coherent or cohesive. Making it set in the 60s seemed needless since the book was from the 80s. Even if you're going to go trip on the past, the 60s seems way too far back (quick note, Ramon could have been AWOL after being stop-lossed).Second, the stories aren't sacred, I get the need to tweak. But they didn't tweak. They stomped on them and ground out new ones. The greatest thing about these books is the fact there are so many stories. If one doesn't work, pick another. It's hard to tell kids to read a story that is nothing like what they just saw. And I really genuinely wanted to get a new generation of kids involved in these really awesome scary stories.Finally, the ending is abrupt and unfulfilling to say the least. It's never quite established why Sarah Billows had to be our main antagonist, beyond she had the book. If it's because they wanted to leave a sequel hook, it's a just not worth it. I started to, at one point, think Sarah had something to do with our main character's mom, but that went no where. Or maybe it did.I see a lot of people comparing it favourably to Goosebumps. And I loved Goosebumps too. But Scary Stories isn't Goosebumps. There was a bit of silliness, but sometimes downright seriousness and maturity to the stories (Maybe You'll Remember).

tt8350360,4,"Maybe I've seen too many of The Conjuring films now - seven in total with several more on the way, such as a sequel to the excoriable The Nun and The Crooked Man. I even sat through the barely connected The Curse of La Llorona. It's co-written and directed by Gary Dauberman, who wrote the remake of It, as well as Annabelle, Annabelle: Creation and The Nun. Original creator James Wan is the other writer as well as the producer.Back in 1971. demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren - back again at least for a brief cameo to drag you into the theater - are bringing the possessed Annabelle back to their home. Before they even get it there, it brings all manner of hell after them in a pre-title sequence that really has nothing to do with the rest of the movie.After Father Gordon - coming back in another call back to the first two The Conjuring movies - blesses a box for the evil doll, we fast-forward a year to the Warrens bringing in Mary Ellen (Madison Iseman, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle) to watch their daughter Judy (McKenna Grace, who has made something of a career of playing the young versions of characters - she was young Captain Marvel, as well as the child versions of Sabrina on the new Netflix series and Theodora Crain in The Haunting of Hill House).Judy is able to see all manner of ghosts and spirits, like a priest that keeps following her and later protecting her. He's Father Michael Morrisey, playing by Gary-7, who will probably get involved in a later The Conjuring movie. Or maybe not. Sadly, I'll probably be there the first night with the vague hope that this will finally be the one that equals the original.Mary Ellen's friend Daniela decides to visit the Warren house, as she wants to speak to the dead, specifically her father, who recently died after a car crash. She was the driver and blames herself, which brings her into the Warren's hidden sanctum of the scariest and most sinister of all occult objects. She ends up touching everything and leaving Annabelle's container wide open, showing that not only is she a moron, but she also has no idea how to read. Finally, she uses an artifact called the Mourner's Bracelet, which certainly will play a part in another film. That's all these movies have become, a kickoff to the next film which introduces the next character which tells us all about the next character for the next one. I get it. I've been paying for it ever since the second one.Anyways, this dumb teenage girl is like, maybe my dad will talk to me through something in this room, which means that Annabella is able to gather all of the other spirits and attack, spirits who I will eventually pay to see their own movies and buy their DVD's, like a ferryman, a bride, a samurai, a hellhound called the Black Shuck - no, not the song by The Darkness - and, of course, a copy of Milton Bradley's Feeley Meeley game.Actually, the Black Shuck is based on a famous Warren case - which is the same as me saying that I have cases when all I'm doing is lying about ghosts - where a werewolf was killing local livestock. Kinda like the chicken that gets it here.Everybody gets attacked by different spirits, like Bob dealing with the hellhound, Mary Ellen getting dragged away by Charon the boatman or whatever we want to call the ferryman with coins on his eyes and Judy has to deal with Annabelle herself, who just up and got in bed with her. Daniela? Well, she's trapped in the artifact room and being terrorized by a monkey that plays drums. Whoever sold those things and who bought them? Maniacs, that's who. Every adult that I ever knew that had one continually used them to torture children. It's like they had an underground network of mean grown-ups who thought it was funny to give kids nightmares.There's one great scene in the middle of all of this, as Daniela watches an old television that shows a mute vision of a few seconds in the future where she'll be screaming and covered in blood. It's the most frightening thing in the movie - hell, in the last couple of these films - and it's a total throwaway. The same with the scene where the kids try to call Lorraine for help and a demon is on the other end. These bring forth primal childhood fears unlike the rest of the storyline.It all ends with Daniela possessed by The Bride, but the priest and Judy play a movie of the original exorcism over the girl, freeing her, while Mary Ellen tries to lock Annabelle back in her cabinet. Of course the next day, the parents come home and every kid ends up coming to a birthday party and Ed plays guitar while Lorraine has a psychic talk with Daniela. You didn't expect a happy ending?I kinda love - or totally hate to be honest - that this movie is being called an intraquel, as it is set during the opening and main plot of the first film. This renders it meaningless, a film that has no true bearing on anything that has come before or since.I guess the only thing we learn here is that the demon inside AnnabelleThe identity of the demon primarily attached to the Annabelle doll is called the Ram, which makes sense, as the cult group in the 1960's that Janice ""Annabelle"" Higgins belonged to was the Disciples of the Ram. The fact that I know this much - and didn't need any reference to call that up - means that for some reason, I know more about the Conjuring universe than my own family.

tt8350360,5,I'm a fan of The Conjuring and the other Annabelle movies but this one was disappointing. The acting was fine but the story a as weak and the ending was horrible. At least they kept the time period feeling. I expected more from this series.,Annabelle Comes Home,2019-06-26,5.9,59199,2019
tt8350360,1,"SPOILER ALERT ... this film is c**p !! There you go. An insult to the genre and the franchise, but more importantly, to my intelligence. There was a werewolf, yes a werewolf! Even if you could justify its appearance you couldn't explain it. Avoid. Hang on to the memories of the first two movies and the conjuring series.

tt8350360,3,"The Conjuring movies (1 &2) are two of my favorite horror movies. The first Annabelle movie was not great. The second one was actually very good. I did not have much by way of expectations, and this movie failed miserably to even meet those. Pacing, horrendous. No Warrens. Too many unnecessary monsters and ghosts with little to no story or purpose. Characters (especially one) doing the whole I'm-going-to-touch-this-or-go-in-here-because-I-can. Honestly, the horror is skimpy and stereotypical. Some scenes dragged on forever with no purpose. My wife, especially, was looking forward to this and is usually forgiving of bad horror movie elements, but even she called it ""trash"".

Parents leave, just the kid and the babysitters in the house, house is haunted, ghosts everywhere, jump scares, then some jump scares, some more jump scares, then some more jump scares, oh and some more jump scares.
I mean honestly do they really think that this is actually scary, do they think they're viewers are 5 years old. Might as well have gone into a haunted house, at least I would actually enjoy it. I really hope this isn't how the next horror films are going to play out. What they need to do is actually hire some real writers, spend more than 5 minutes on the plot, the scary stuff, etc. spend some actual money on the movie as well so we can have some actual good special effects. Why waste our time with this excuse of a ""horror film"". When I watch a horror movie I want to actually be terrified. There needs to be more than just jump scares, like a really creepy plot and characters, kind of like the first two insidious movies, I actually had nightmares from those movies.
Watch this movie if you just need to fill an hour and a half while waiting for your parents or your wife and kids at the mall, don't expect anything new or original or certainly scary.",Annabelle Comes Home,2019-06-26,5.9,59199,2019

As everyone said slow , legit takes the movie an hour just to get to the ""good"" parts. Daniella *sighs* was the absolute worst , I think she should've died or at least gotten badly hurt 😩 The whole movie was her fault. It made sense or even an attempt to do so. The 3 girls seen creepy things before reaching the climax and ignored them as if they're not in a house that has a room of possessed possessions. As if the sh** is normal👀
After that one VERY long day everyone just brushed it all off as if nothing even happened, as if Ed and Lorraine shouldn't know the severity of Annabelle's actual strength.
They had many opportunities to escape but ignored all the signs of danger beforehand. A waste , I'm so happy I didn't pay to see this because I spent the whole movie yelling at it😄
All in all , my main point is they never made an attempt to get in the CAR & LEAVE🤦‍♀️I'm not even going to proof read this before I post it to make sure it makes sense, just like the producers didn't before releasing this movie.",Annabelle Comes Home,2019-06-26,5.9,59199,2019

There were many scenes were they were acually funny because this film has some comedic scenes unlike the previous ones. The funny scenes were the ones I enjoyed. The girl that plays the Warrens´daughter did a great job but her character was not believable as she was fighting demons like a superhero. The Warrens were in the movie for about 5 or 10 minutes.

After watching it I thought it had a PG(12+) rating because of the lack of gore or actual horror happening but it actually is rated R(16+) for some reason..

There were too many ideas and they all clashed and the story didn't make sense at times. The ""comedy"" scenes felt awkward and forced, just like The Nun, and overall came across like it was supposed to be a teen suspense film rather than a horror film. It kept me at the edge off my seat a bit but never went beyond that.

But this movie was just a honest waste of time and money in my opinion. The pace of the movie was quite slow during the times it led to the jump scares; which were also very mediocre. The character ""Daniella"" was unbearable to watch. As well as the ending was so stupidly abrupt. It was comparable to the ""when she woke up she realized it was all just a dream"" scenario. You would expect the characters involved in this movie to be genuinely traumatized after such an event, but no they all were happy as if nothing happened.

This was embarrassing and I felt embarrassed by being in middle of the theatre. How is it possible that we still allow crap like this to be successful?! After years and years of cliches and predictability in the horror category there are still movies like this filled with stupid jumpscares, suspense that goes nowhere, empty dialogues etc etc and still have big budgets in order to create crap! That's what makes me mad, millions of profit for garbage!
Everything was predictable except the ending because I could not believe it was going to be finished in such a mediocre way! I did not want to believe it was going to be so insulting! And those ridiculous zoomings???? This was begging to be bad...3,50 euros is cheap but even if it was a few cents I would still feel robbed.
I realized it was a mistake as soon as I walked in the room and saw it packed with teens. This is what we have today: cheap stinkin' movies, songs and products to please a generation that is not demanding and do not ask for quality.

tt8350360,1,"Okay, enough with the ULTRA dark digital filters. Back when horror movies were good, dark meant they used a fast film with a wide aperture in a dark shooting environment. This would result in rich detailed dark areas, high contrast and crisp shadow lines. They don't use film that much anymore so what we get is a regularly exposed video signal, in a normally lit environment that is then subjected to a digital filter that darkens the image uniformly. What that means is when you are viewing the movie EVERYTHING is dark. There is no contrast, no detail, just MURK. I thought that Slenderman movie would've drove a dagger in the heart of this school of cinematography but apparently not.Aside from that the movie is incredibly dull. It has a bunch of retread scare attempts that don't work at all. Actually not a single frightening scene in the entire movie. The actors were good. They just had nothing to react to.

tt8350360,5,"Although horror is not my favourite film genre, and have made that known more than once before in the past, there is still high appreciation for it. Although there are a fair share of average at best films or even clunkers (even when trying to take them for what they are or intend to be), there are also an equal fair share of good horror films as well as classics, which won't be named in order to be fair.Really enjoyed the two 'The Conjuring' films for the same reasons to each other, that they were well-made, well-crafted, suspenseful, entertaining and had genuine shocks. 'Annabelle' is inevitably compared to them, but to me it doesn't compare favourably and could have been much better. Its prequel 'Annabelle: Creation', although far from perfect or great with some of the same mistakes being made, again to me fared better, though again not close to the quality of 'The Conjuring' films. 'The Nun' meanwhile was a mediocre disappointment. Put 'Annabelle Comes Home' in the middle and personally found it a difficult film to rate and review, though it will be easier for others.'Annabelle Comes Home' looks good. There is a great Gothic atmosphere, lush and darkly atmospheric production design and stylish photography. The supernatural effects are surprisingly excellent too. The music is haunting and the direction brings a genuine eeriness and mysteriousness in places. There are parts that are suitably uneasy and eerie once 'Annabelle Comes Home' gets going.The pace, again once the film gets into gear, it has been said that the mute vision in the television is the scariest part and do have to agree with this. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga do good jobs, though take a backseat to the younger cast. Was worried that this would not work, but the younger cast carry the film quite well and don't bore and annoy as feared.However, the story is near-non existent with few surprises and can get very silly. Especially towards the end. Although there are moments of scares and suspense, there are not enough of either and could have done with more build up that would have made them less predictable.Did feel that the pacing was still very flawed. 'Annabelle Comes Home' takes too long to get going and then the climactic parts feel very rushed. The ending is one of the film's biggest issues, as well as being rushed it was very anti-climactic and bordered on plain ridiculous, as well as illogical. The dialogue is no improvement too, very awkward-sounding and banal, doing little with developing rather clichéd characters.Summarising, difficult to rate and review. Watchable but never rises above borderline between average and decent. 5/10",Annabelle Comes Home,2019-06-26,5.9,59199,2019

It's a fun movie. An action comedy production that does not take itself as seriously as the Bond franchise, for example. It's honest and very similar to it's predecessors, with the benefit of better technology and cinematography of its time.
Its silly, because it was always supposed to be silly. There's no man hating, AT ALL, no matter what the other reviews say. It is, yes, heavy on its feminism, but I trust by now we learned that feminism does not equal man hating? Good.
Kristen Stewart is a gem in this. And I didn't even like her before. Sam Claflin is also, muah. Chefs kiss.
Elizabeth Bank's wig could be better.

tt5033998,10,"Very entertaining and enjoyable. A welcome update to the Charlie's Angels franchise.I might not have given it full stars because action movies aren't my go-to. But the first review that imdb was displaying was an off-topic review about how someone thinks this movie is ""offensive to men,"" encouraging people to skip it. Dude: it's not for you. Go review something you can relate to. If you can't accept the ""woman power"" spin on the genre and/or appreciate that apart from that angle it has all the expected elements of any other film from that genre -- plus enjoyable performances by top actors (all genders)*, and minus the loud, testosterone-driven constant cursing and braindead violence that seems to infect so many movies that, therefore, I have no interest in watching -- then it's not for you. You don't get it. Imdb, don't feature a review by someone who can't even ""see"" the movie and then encourages others not to see it!I looked up the ""rookie angel"" on imdb. Turns out she played live-action Princess Jasmine in the Aladdin movie, and is playing the pink power ranger in an upcoming movie. I think of how my niece and nephew watched a bunch of animated princesses when they were little, and they were certain that princesses are magical beings with superpowers. Maybe that will translate into a generation that appreciates the awesome capabilities of women. That's part of the audience for this movie, and that's great.*Of all the performances I liked in this movie, maybe the tops were the two Stewarts -- Kristen and Sir Patrick. Love!

Honestly, the hardest part for me was realising I was going to see Elizabeth Banks or Patrick Stewart go evil, but it worked for a great story and brilliant ending.

tt5033998,10,"We know now that almost every single film in history has had some political agenda, a lot of times filmmakers have just not been aware they are psychologically influencing people how to be or see the world. This is something so admirable about these recent films that have managed to abandon the old paradigm, they are more self aware about themselves and the power of their beliefs they are spreading through actions, words or themes in their films, which is something I'm grateful to see in more and more films these days, because they're far more conducive to healthy human spirit and condition than ever before, especially when they used to be so unconscious.What I love about this film is how for a change filmmakers are making mockery of gender or race stereotypes, especially in a film that that is largely removed from reality in terms of the genre or story. This is easily one of the best spy films of the last 2 decades, and certainly the best film this year so far. It just needs to find the right audience, many losers just go watching films only to end up feeling miserable, this is not for them, all it shows is just how they waste their life, it has nothing to do with the movie, be always mindful of that, as some of them probably are not.",Charlie's Angels,2019-11-15,4.8,58605,2019

Elizabeth Banks did a great job, and she expressed a certain amount of respect to all the previous Angels films, this is clear and obvious here. Kristen Stewarts once again proved she is an actress of wide scope and awesome zeal. She shows great gusto and virtually cuts all corners excellent way. Mark Lieberman of The Washington Post wrote that Stewart ""upstages everyone, from the opening close-up on her gleeful grin to her array of colorful costumes, riotous non sequiturs and unconventional posture choices."" True to the core.
Naomi Scott and Ella Balinska are very good choices for two other leads, too. Their chemistry is palpable and works fine all through the movie. Men leads? Yeah, very good, as well. Patrick Stewart,Jonathan Tucker and others do not seem lame or weak or lost behind the powerful female leads. A neat balance is here and it works, oh yes.
Smart fun film that takes a bit slower start but then goes on well and fast.

The anti-propaganda must have been very strong. The women behind this film must have stepped on some long toes in the industry. So reluctantly I started to watch it on Netflix. It is refreshing to have strong intelligent, resilient women in a film. All of them. Not being exploited for their sexuality, emotions or submissiveness. Some people in here say they are taking men down? Please, as if this didn't happen to female characters for like in the past 100 years. It is a slapstick action film, or over the top camp action. It succeeds! It IS entertaining! It is well directed, well edited, well acted. A good film for women and girls to see.

tt5033998,10,"Tons of fun. Fits perfectly in the genre of silly action movie that doesn't try to be realistic or serious. Along the lines of The Fast and the Furious.All of the main characters have a good dose of personality, and they're all fun to watch, and clearly having fun making it, Jane to a lesser extent, but she is playing the serious character, so not really her fault.It's a pretty funny movie, mostly intentional, but there are also a few moments of unintentional humor that just add to the intentional humor. The setting montages are poorly edited, but this ends up adding to the goodness of the movie because they're so good-bad. The CGI is similar in this regard. There are a couple moments when it looks rather cheap. But as I said, it just adds on to the healthy dose of intentional humor.Some people are saying this reboot was pointless or unnecessary, but I disagree. It's been a long time since the last Charlie's Angels. I watched it not long ago and it felt so dated it lost my attention. I'm not saying it's bad, but it's very much from a different era.For the record, I would actually give this an 8/10, but since all the butthurt neck beards with fragile egos are giving this 1s and 2s, I'm trying to restore balance to the force.",Charlie's Angels,2019-11-15,4.8,58605,2019

tt5033998,10,"I think I am liking Kristen Stewart more because of her acting in this movie. So much more expressiveness than in Twilight. Her character is also quite likeable.The hate on the movie on IMDB is probably because the users of IMDB are generally older due to the site being one of the pioneers of movie review sites, most of them are fans of the original. Nowadays there are much more movie review sites.I feel lucky that I did not remember much about the original, otherwise maybe I might also have hated this?The feminism in the movie is actually quite subtle, I don't think it is as preachy as haters are saying. They are probably just too sensitive.Anyway, it is fun, hilarious and has a good pace although it doesn't have an amazing plot. It deserves 6/10 or 7/10.

The storyline is very simple but nothing wrong with a little simplicity. Not all movies should be unpredictable. Predictable doesn't mean unsatisfying.

I'm not that familiar with her, but she really bears her soul here.The film balances comedy and drama skillfully, I won't go into too much detail, but the audience here in Australia was laughing out loud throughout and my wife and I had tears by the end.This is what I go to the movies for.The good:

Deducted one star for historical accuracy, but then again the family's background was not the central focus of the film so the inaccuracy did not take away from the plot. Nonetheless, for such a renowned team of filmmakers it's weird to see such a slip-up happen.

tt8623904,8,"Kate/Katarina (Emilia Clarke) is an immigrant to Britain, with her family, coming after Yugoslavia broke up. Once singing in church, she longs to make it in musical theater. However, life has thrown her off track. Her mother (Emma Thompson) is overbearing, her sister is a successful lawyer with sharp disagreements with Kate, and our Katarina has health problems. So, now, Kate works at a year-round Christmas store, as an elf-saleslady under the direction of store owner, Santa (Michelle Yeoh). Its a living? Well, yes, but Kate has been couch surfing and has no permanent home but her parents house. One day she meets a handsome man on a bicycle, Tom (Henry Golding) who advises her to ""look up"". Its akin to stop and smelling the roses but Kate wants none of this gooey philosophy, at first. But, on subsequent encounters, Kate begins to notice things she's never seen before and to appreciate the friendship/love Tom has been offering. Can Tom change Kate's life for the good? This lovely new addition to the repertoire of Christmas cinema has a strong foundation in its script by Emma Thompson, a wonderful cast, lovely sets and costumes, and the eternally grand music of George Michael in its soundtrack.

tt8623904,9,"Thank you Emma Thompson for producing this very underrated movie. Does it have the quality of Game of Thrones character development and storylines? No. Does it have the same appeal as Crazy Rich Asians? Probably not. But, does it do a great job putting a musician's catalog of songs into a fictional story? ABSOLUTELY!If you're a George Michael fan, and watch the movie from his song's perspective and get past the romantic comedy category that this film falls under, you'll appreciate what it does to his music. Is there cheese? Sure, but that's part of the charm to get to the twist.Not knowing the twist is the best way to watch this movie to experience what it is doing in dedication to George Michael.I would have rated this movie a 10, but they missed out on some of George's songs that they could have included, but for whatever reason, they didn't.If you got this far in my review and you haven't seen it, and you're a George Michael fan, and you're into the Christmas spirit...

tt8623904,8,"""Last Christmas"" is a funny, heartwarming, ultimately profound movie. It's being marketed as a romantic comedy but it's more of a dramedy. There are funny lines throughout, but ""Last Christmas"" deals with some tough issues, and towards the end it sends a beautiful message.Emma Thompson co-wrote the script. Thompson previously won an Academy Award for best adapted screenplay for ""Sense and Sensibility."" ""Last Christmas"" traffics in unflattering stereotypes of Eastern Europeans and it tries to hard to be politically correct, but its wit, warmth, and the chemistry of its stars, Emilia Clarke and Henry Golding, won me over.The movie opens in the former Yugoslavia, in an Orthodox church, of all places. Petra (Emma Thompson) is watching her daughter Katrina sing a George Michael song.Fast forward decades later, and move to London. Kate (Emilia Clarke) is an unlikable mess. She works as an elf / clerk in a year-round Christmas store run by Santa (Michelle Yeoh). Kate is homeless and couch surfs, sleeping with friends and one-night stands. She dresses in clothes that are a little bit slob and a little bit tramp. She's hard to like.One day she looks out the window of her Christmas store and sees Tom (Henry Golding.) He's a very nice guy. Charming, handsome, and kind. Kate is suspicious.Eventually Kate and Tom get close enough that Kate confesses her dark secret to him. She had been ill for a long time. Her mother seemed to enjoy too much having a chronically ill daughter, so Kate had to move out of the house. A year earlier, Kate had had a heart transplant, and she hasn't felt like herself since. Tom encourages Kate to get her life together.Kate returns to her natal family, now living in London. Petra, Kate's mother, is a stereotypical Eastern European. She is always sad, she sings mournful songs, she uses outlandish curses - ""I will nail you to my p----"" - and she refers to a dessert brought by a gay guest as ""lesbian pudding.""The TV broadcasts coverage of Brexit protests and Petra bemoans that people dislike her because she is an immigrant. But she is a bigot herself, albeit a comical one. ""I blame the Poles,"" she says, about current anti-immigrant sentiment in the UK. All this is played for laughs. Otherwise, the movie bends over backward to be politically correct. Four relationships are highlighted in the film, and all four are biracial, and one is a lesbian couple. The one group this politically correct film recognizes it is okay to make fun of is Eastern Europeans. Even so, I loved the movie.There are no spoilers in this review, so I can't tell you how the movie handles Kate's transformation, from a total mess at the beginning of the film, to someone we can take to heart at the end, but I found the plot device to be quite poignant, and I left the theater with tears rolling down my face. The critics who have given this film a low score need to have their credentials revoked and their minds and hearts opened. Emilia Clarke and Henry Golding have terrific chemistry, and I'd love to see them reunite in a more traditional romantic comedy.",Last Christmas,2019-11-08,6.5,56323,2019

tt8623904,7,"First Hit: It started off on the silly side, and by the end, I was very touched by this heartfelt story.I'd seen the previews for this story and thought, oh, this could be a silly sort of way to spend an hour and a half. However, I'm glad I didn't judge the movie by the preview. It has a beautiful and deeply touching message.The story begins with watching a young Kate (Madison Ingoldsby as young Kate) being the lead singer in a Yugoslavian church choir. Her mother, Petra (Emma Thompson), Ivan her father (Boris Isakovic), and her sister Marta (young Marta played by Lucy Miller) are in the audience watching. There is a moment in this scene that plays out later with the sister Marta looking at another person in the choir.Roll into the future, and the twenty-something years old Kate (Emilia Clarke) is living in London as is her whole family. Kate is working at a Christmas store that's open year-round, owned by ""Santa"" (Michelle Yeoh), who loves Christmas and the magic it brings. Kate is her employee and dresses like an elf. We get that Kate isn't a perfect employee but that Santa likes her for some reason.Kate rushes out of the store to make singing and acting auditions but is usually late, rarely prepared, and seems to have lost her ability to sing as well. We soon get that Kate's in a rut, which is compounded by her almost always homelessness. She's often shown dragging around her roller suitcase. At times, when she needs a place to sleep, she picks up guys in bars, sleeps with them, but something invariably happens, and she's back on the streets.Her friends, like Jenna and Rufus (Ritu Arya and Ansu Kabia respectively), give her a room, but within two days, she's messed this up, and they ask her to leave. She tries to reconcile with her family, but her mom is tough, and her father hides from her mom as much as possible. She and her sister Marta (Lydia Leonard) seem to be at each other's throats, and there appears to be no love lost anywhere. The family dynamics are really screwed up.All during these scenes, we are under the impression that Kate has no common sense, is flighty, and very ungrounded. Some would say unlucky. There is some hint that something happened to Kate about a year ago, but at this stage in the film, we are not privy to that part of the story. Did this event cause this ungrounded flighty nature?One day Tom (Henry Golding) pops into her life one day and impresses upon her to take a walk with him. She declines, but on the second random meeting, they walk, and you can see his caring and compassion for others, including Kate. The chemistry is strong between them, and he just seems like a wonderfully lovely person who's taken an interest in Kate. She wants to see him again and asks for his mobile number, but he says he doesn't use it, and it's kept in a kitchen cupboard at home, so giving Kate his name would be useless.On one of the walks, Tom takes her to a homeless shelter. Thinking he's trying to get her to stay there, she discovers; differently, he volunteers his time at the shelter and says she could help as well. But as Tom is prone to do, Tom disappears for days at a time. No one seems to know where he is.Kate begins to sing outside the shelter, collecting money, hoping that Tom will pop-up again. Alas, he doesn't, but just as she becomes even more despondent Tom shows up again.One evening she tells him what happen to her a year ago and why she doesn't feel like a whole person anymore. It is genuinely a sweet scene. He tells her that she can change her life by being open to others and by making kinder decisions. She's not a victim and can change her life.Tom's influence has a positive effect on Kate. She starts to make amends with ""Santa,"" her mom, dad, and sister. She volunteers more at the homeless shelter and is more thoughtful. An example of this is early in the film we see her getting picked up at a bar from some guy using a standard line. Now, we see her in a bar, she gets the same pickup line from another bloke, and she makes a better decision.A fun secondary story is about ""Santa"" trying to find companionship dates for herself. One day ""Santa"" meets ""boy"" (Peter Mygind), and how they engage with each other is so sweet and funny.I cannot delve into what happens to Kate that made her feel the way she does, nor how Tom is there to help her see the light, but the story is sweet, and the ending was fun and touching.Clarke is a hoot and actually inspirational as the film moved along. She did a great job of making this character work. Golding was beautiful as the man who pops into Kate's life to provide hope and inspiration. Yeoh is hilarious as the Christmas store owner who can see Kate's sweet side. Mygind was excellent as ""boy,"" the man who brought joy to ""Santa's"" life. Arya and Kabia are fantastic as Kate's friends, who keep supporting and allowing her to get better. Thompson was oddly funny and entertaining in her role as Kate's mother. Isakovic was terrific as the browbeaten husband of Petra and Kate's father. Leonard was harsh in her role as Kate's sister, with whom there were a lot of animosities. I didn't think this part of the film was developed enough, and their conversations felt too jarring at times. Thompson and Bryony Kimmings wrote this screenplay that didn't telegraph the ending, and that was a good thing. Paul Feig got the feel of this story right.Overall: After the end credits, I was surprised by how much I ended up liking this film.",Last Christmas,2019-11-08,6.5,56323,2019

No, it's not going to become an annual Christmas classic, but so what. It's a sweet, decent, amusing and (believe it or not) somewhat endearing little tale of redemption and humanity. It's not complex or deep, and it's not trying to be. So, ignore the Grinches out there and go see it. But be careful. You just might have fun!",Last Christmas,2019-11-08,6.5,56323,2019

tt8623904,4,"People don't usually expect much from Christmas movies, they are all more or less the same - plenty of Christmas music, nice atmosphere and warm stories. The trailer promised a whole lot of that, but the movie itself did not live up to my expectations, which were quite low to start with. The concept itself is quite okay, Katarina is working towards a better life after going through a heart surgery, but is generally a mess. Who isn't, by the way? This storyline is perfect for a Christmas movie, she meets a man (or more precisely, imagines a man), he helps her, everything is cool.
BUT the other storyline, relating to her Croatian roots is a bigger mess than she is. The opening scene, a children's choir in a church in Yugoslavia... well, we all know how plausible that is. I'll tell you anyhow - it is not. Not only because the religion was not ""a thing"" back then, but also because it says 1999. Yugoslavia was long gone by then. The language they speak throughout the movie is anything but, it was a messy hybrid between Croatian and Russian and Macedonian and I don't even know what other language. Also, if they all come from Croatia, how come her mother's Croatian is so much worse than her father's? The casting was done terribly in that sense. A Balkan actor for the father, but an English actress for the mother? I'll pass.
Also, her mother blaming Poles for the situation makes no sense at all, and neither does the fact that they curse at each other at the dinner table. We don't do that. The respect for other family members is a huge thing here, and we would certainly not say those things to our parents just out of the blue.
Finally, the choice of George Michael's songs did not fit the story points at all, it all seemed misplaced.
In my opinion, it is just not worth watching. Go watch Home Alone for a 1000th time, you'll have more fun at least.",Last Christmas,2019-11-08,6.5,56323,2019

tt8695030,3,"I hate this movie. I saw it for free and still want my money back. It is an absolutely pointless, meandering vanity project that attempts to trick you into thinking it's cleverer than it is. According to the director himself, it was designed to be a dumb movie comprised of dumb bits as a way to make money hanging out with his friends. And what's worse is that the trailer tricks you into thinking it is an entirely different movie - the worst kind of lie you can tell in an effort to lure people away from their hard-earned money and precious time.There is literally no point to anything that happens; Jarmusch has no sense of pace or urgency or meaning. And in my opinion, art for the sake of itself alone is condescending towards your audience. I normally like his work, along with all of the actors, the subject matter and tone - this should have been right in my wheelhouse. But I left feeling like the director had a contemptuous view of the people watching his film (in EVERY regard) and that just doesn't sit well with me. Not everything has to matter in a movie, but SOMETHING should.Ultimately, it felt like a third-rate SNL skit that was allowed to drag on for two hours.",The Dead Don't Die,2019-06-14,5.5,55100,2019
tt8695030,1,"I would highly avoid seeing this. It's slow with a stupid plot that goes nowhere. Saw about 10 people walk out of the theatre. Bill Murray was not funny at all. The film tries to repeat dumb jokes that aren't funny. Random UFO shows up and takes away a Scottish Samurai funeral director. Side plots that go nowhere and wastes about 20 minutes of the movie. The entire cast was wasted, just like the two hours of my life watching this trash of a movie. This was not art, but it was a big middle finger to anyone who had to sit through it. It's almost as if the director wanted to make the worst movie ever just to say ""I made the worst movie ever."" Why release this to theaters? It should of been free on Netflix.

It is very dry comedy with lots of deadpan and significant fourth wall breaking. If you don't find anything amusing in the first 10 minutes, then you should probably move on to something else.Over the top political commentary. Side stories that go absolutely nowhere and are seemingly just forgotten. Random plots events that make no sense to the rest of the movie. All things I normally hate in a movie, but this time it just works. The reason for this is a fourth wall break that you don't initially realize is a fourth wall break. Very early in the movie and throughout it, Adam Driver's character says, ""This isn't going to end well."" It isn't obvious that he's talking about the movie itself. So when all the ridiculous plot points happen and the side stories are abandoned, it is HILARIOUS because he's been telling the viewer all along that was going to happen.",The Dead Don't Die,2019-06-14,5.5,55100,2019

tt8695030,3,"I think this movies tries to have it all. The director/writer threw everything possible at this movie and i think sometimes it just doesn't work.The metaphor that is used is very on the nose but i think it is an important metaphor. However this is not the only one, they then start piling more metaphors on about greed and i think it starts to loose value when you can't commit to one thing. Also just because a movie is metaphorical doesn't make it good. I have seen people comment ""You just didn't get it"". Yeah i did, it was still messy.It is also painfully slow. Nothing happens for a very very large chunk of this movie. It just has cameos dotted in through it so that people will be like ""Oh cool i love _____"". I think the case is a huge issue as well.Now i love a lot of the people in this cast. It is such a good cast but that is where the studio or someone let the movie down. They pushed so hard about the cast that they made it all rest on them. A lot of the promotion for the movie just talked about the cast, even the poster on IMBd literally talks about the cast. I don't know if they did this because they knew they couldn't market it any other way, i don't know.Talking of marketing i went into this thinking it was a comedy and then about 30-40 minutes in i thought i needed to check to see if it actually was a comedy so i googled it. I can't even say the jokes were unfunny because i feel it had a lack of jokes and I'm not just talking about really obvious jokes it just wasn't humorous. There were moments, more so later on that i was like ""Hm that's a bit funny"" but i think that's why people also don't like it because it was marketed as the ""Funniest all-Star cast"" and it just wasn't.I have never watched any of this directors other films and i do want to as i think he could make interesting films like there were ideas like the dust coming from zombies and not blood. I really liked that and thought it was a bit different.So if you like this directors movies you might like this one but i don't know, it was just so slow and stagnant.",The Dead Don't Die,2019-06-14,5.5,55100,2019
tt8695030,7,"Typical Jarmush. Is it slow paced? Check. Is it dialogue heavy? Check. Is it absurd at times? Check.
To the people that complain it's not action packed enough I would reply it's as action packed as Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai.
Also I think because this movie has zombies in it people give it lots of low reviews, because it's a case of missed expectations.
There's a simple filter you can use to decide whether to watch it. If you enjoyed any of the previous Jarmush movies you won't be heavily disappointed. While not an instant classic it's true to his style. If not, maybe start with one of his earlier movies (Broken Flowers, Night on Earth, Ghost Dog, Dead Man) to get a taste of Jarmush first.",The Dead Don't Die,2019-06-14,5.5,55100,2019

tt8695030,3,"Yeah I get that this is a big satirical commentary on zombie movie tropes, blended in with a big metaphorical commentary on society, and capped with a little diatribe from Tom Waits as the ""outward observer"", but the entire thing is just SO slow that it's utterly boring. I literally fell asleep in the middle of it and had to start it over again. The jokes aren't funny and the story elements go nowhere.Maybe if they hadn't spent so much money on the rock-star cast of A-list celebrities they would have had more left over in the budget for a story with jokes. Honestly I think the reason the whole thing moved so dreadfully slow is because they had to find a way to fill 90 minutes. Watch the thing at 1.5x normal playback speed, and maybe the high-pitched voices and better pacing will make it salvageable.",The Dead Don't Die,2019-06-14,5.5,55100,2019
tt8695030,8,"A clever, onion-skinned movie that reflects back on the audience the true horror of zombies.We're all addicted to something, lost in a world of thought, each finding ourselves outside of ourselves while the world falls apart around us. And, on top of this we're all reading off a different script, all on different pages, a mess of half-opinions and echoed sentiment we're really not thinking through. We're sloppy and entitled, lost and confused, zombies one and all.So, it makes sense that this movie would be lost on us.A good movie. Whimsical, boring, strange, funny. Great characters that don't go quite where you want them to. Plot-lines and arcs you expect to manifest but don't. But... That's the point. Our expectations are what drive us, make us zombies... Our expectation of coffee or chardonnay, Wi-Fi and guitars.Prepare to have your expectations woefully and beautifully trashed then.

tt8695030,1,"The trailer of this movie honestly belies the state of the actual movie. If you watch the trailer, it attempts to convey a more action oriented approach, with aspects of comedy that are quite synonymous with Zombie movies in recent times. However, the movie itself is nowhere like the trailer attempted to portray it as. Everything in the movie is slow, dull, and seems to just be meandering its way through scenes. Watching it, you really want to like it. You're thinking to yourself that the build up is going to be worth it. However, the more of it you watch, you will begin to feel as though the movie is not going to change, and it doesn't. The entire movie is extremely blah from start to finish.At first, as I've already stated, this was not necessarily a bad thing. I enjoy a build up as much as anyone else. And when one of the officers say ""It's zombies"", you sort of laugh about it, because you as a viewer know they're right. You expect the other characters to laugh at the person who said it. But this is not what happens. In fact, everyone in the town immediately assumes zombies, without having actually seen a zombie themselves. The police officers also visit a nearby graveyard to inspect the local graves...again, they have no reason to believe it's actually zombies. No one has seen a zombie up until that point, and no logical person would ever immediately jump to the conclusion of zombies. If this was the purpose of the movie-to convey a sense of vertigo-it was done poorly by the end of the movie. I cannot stress that enough.There are also two major 4th wall breaks. The first of which, you don't quite register what the person is talking about. So when they say ""It's the theme song"", you wonder to yourself are they actually talking about the movie? Is this something that will be explained later? Surely they wouldn't break the 4th wall like that...and then you see the second 4th wall break, where one of the police officers literal states ""He knows how the movie ends, because he read the script"". Even though I'm all for clever 4th wall breaks, this one honestly urinated me off (bypassing language filter), because it showed just how much the director of the movie didn't care about the movie itself. Immersion broken 100%, and not in a good way.Did I mention they throw in random alien cameos? No? Well, they do. And it honestly had absolutely no place in this film. Nothing was explained in this film. Absolutely nothing. Why is it perpetual day, and then suddenly night? Something about the Earth's Tilt, any further questions? Screw you. Why is the dead coming back to life? Again, screw you. Why was someone in the town secretly an alien? Screw you. What was the point of the alien in the police station? Screw you. There are so many things wrong with this script that I honestly couldn't convey them all here if I tried.If you watch this movie, go back and watch the trailer again. The trailer is a 100% different movie. And I'm personally wondering how no one is getting a lawsuit for false advertising after something like that.TL;DRThe trailer blatantly lied about the content and pace of the movie. This movie is nothing but lost potential. It doesn't know what it wants to be, and has no idea of realizing what it wants to be.",The Dead Don't Die,2019-06-14,5.5,55100,2019

There would be no heroes, every normal human who is weird or quirky, angry, or downright boring would be affected, and there would be no happy ending. It would end the way the film does, exactly the way you would expect it to: immediate, bloody, and uneventful. It's just like every day life would be, except with zombies killing you. Boring, routine, ordinary, ends with you going to bed.This film is a brilliant commentary on not just public consumption, but society in general and the state of entitlement of instant gratification.

tt8695030,5,"All the ingredients to produce a masterpiece are present: 1) A director I love, Jim Jarmusch, due to the excellent Paterson (2016) and Broken Flowers (2005). 2) A to-die-for cast, with Bill Murray in particular. 3) A sens of humor that regularly flirts with the absurd, including wacky and irreverent dialogues like « a black coffee please, but not too black » for instance. 4) The mesmerizing voice of Tom Waits. 5) A slight criticism of our society, especially the progressive global warming because of a strong procrastination with regard to the respect of our environment, and, albeit to a lesser extent, consumerism. 6) Zombies! I may confess that I have a crush on zombies. 7) ...So, all the ingredients are lumped together but, it's quite strange and even weird, the recipe is rather unsuccessful: the atmosphere is sometimes cutesy or even insipid, the characters are usually devoid of enthusiasm and quite often apathetic, and the final scene rhymes with bitterness and bewilderment.Although the film is not completely lousy thanks to a few successful scenes, I was globally bored and disappointed. In my humble opinion, this movie is a non-event and, as an echo with itself, should be buried alive, from now on until the end of the world.

You are supposed to laugh at usage of the same line thats repeated over and over until the last person rolls his eyes in agony. Sarcastic remarks are made to hit the audience over the head with the absurdity of the situation, thrown in with some blunt 4th wall breaking. Nothing works, not even the acting. While the main cast is supposed to be almost apathic at the outbreak of a zombie apacolypse, it geniuely kills the mood and every sense of drama or tension. After this you will wonder if Adam Driver cant really act and Bill Murray was high or thinking about his paycheck the while time.There are no pay-offs to character arcs and they push some weird social commentary over the cause of the outbreak thats so mindnumbingly obvious and in your face it loses all weight, plus voice-over to really hammer home the fact how humans where zombie-like to begin with on how they consume and want ever more.

tt8695030,3,"What we have here is a ""zombie movie"" written by someone who clearly hates people who love zombie movies. This entire movie was written as a way to mock people who love the genre and it does it in the most boring, droll, dry, and uninspired way imaginable.The characters are beyond bland and hallow. No one has a backstory, they are simply a singular quirk. The acting is delivered purposefully flat to mock how bad acting can be in zombie flicks. Absolutely nothing happens during the first 50 minutes of the movie except bland, dry, empty character interactions. There's no build up, no plot, there is literally nothing. And then zombies with no real explanation except...zombies! Instead of gore we get sprays of dust. Every scenario is a stereotype but not in a fun or comedic way, just in a ""well this is how it's supposed to happen"" way. Then it's wrapped up with an absurd ""twist"", that's done in such a boring way no one will care, and then back to one final stereotype after a little bit of exposition.With this cast this concept could have been something special except by the end of the movie you can feel the directors complete and utter disrespect for the viewers that he's tricked into watching his movie. This was a movie to take the money of people he thinks are idiots and he has no problem showing it during the conclusion of the film. Ultimately this was just such a waste of time. You'll either be bored to death or somewhat offended by the end of this film, I don't recommend it. I only rated it a 3 because it has Bill Murray.",The Dead Don't Die,2019-06-14,5.5,55100,2019

tt8526872,10,"""Dolemite is my name"" is one of my favourite movies of the year so far along with Joker and Parasite. It's largely down to the career best performance by Eddie Murphy, who is simply mesmerising as Rudy Ray Moore. He brings so much energy to this role, along with his charm and humour. Eddie has never been this funny. Most of the jokes are raunchy so it might not be for everyone but it's impossible not to fall in love with Eddie in this film. I hope he is nominated in the best actor category at Oscars. He could even win it because he is that good.Apart from Eddie, the film is full of brilliant performances, in particularly by Wesley Snipes who matches and sometimes steals the show from Eddie. It's a true ensemble. It's a shame that this movie is not getting a wide theatrical release because let me tell you if there is one film this year which needed to be seen on the big screen it's 'Dolemite Is My Name"".

tt8526872,8,"Eddie Murphy is back on top with this biopic of Rudy Ray Moore, the hustler, shameless self-promoter of wildly cornball action-comedies of the 1970s. Murphy has finally found a character to really sink his teeth into...and Murphy relishes every moment of inhabiting the joyful and strangely charming yet naive character desperately searching to simply express himself a an entertainer of the people and for the people. His character is an outsider who elevates other outliers all searching for validation and some simple joys in the midst of working class America.Murphy is funny, charming, and touching as this flawed heroic character. He deserves all the acclaim for bringing this story back to life and surrounding himself with talented ensemble cast and strong direction and wonderfully zany costumes of the 70s era.This film is at times foul and other times touching and it deserves your attention throughout as it revels in the joys of telling a story deserving to be told and to be relished and enjoyed by anyone searching for an escape from the mundane or cynical stories prevalent in movies of today.",Dolemite Is My Name,2019-10-25,7.3,54486,2019

Murphy is fantastic and easily gives the best performance of his career. He really nailed the role and was able to completely vanish into that character. A very award worthy turn and great comeback for him. Another comeback story is Wesley Snipes who is absolutely hilarious and self ironic. Never thought he had that in him and that gives me the feeling his comedic and also dramatic talent was wasted all those years before. Another noteworthy and beautiful turn was done by Da'Vine Joy Randolph. The film itself had a very realistic and colorful look with nice production design and great costume work. The screenplay was very good as was the direction of Craig Brewer. It perfectly mixes comedic elements with dramatic moments and in its result is a very respectful and faithful biopic.

tt8526872,NA,"""How'd my life get so small?"" Rudy Ray Moore (Eddie Murphy, who's not been this good in 30 years)Rudy Ray Moore has been called the father of rap and more certainly a force in the blaxploitation movement several decades ago. ""Dolemite is My Name"" is an entertaining depiction of his rise ( see the above quote at a low moment in his career) to stardom as a recording star and movie actor, but more as a force in the movie enthusiasm for sexy, violent, funny films starring blacks in stories about their own imaginative lives, not those seen through the white lens.Nothing new is added to the docudrama recipe here, although it would seem to call for creativity itself given Rudy's imaginative genius. Yet, a fine performance by Murphy, who captures Rudy's charming enthusiasm and at times naivete (think Ed Wood), anchors the film in Rudy's genial turn of phrases and gentle put downs, an Oscar nomination for Murphy possible.The ensemble cast deserves a nod for supporting Murphy's performance, that allows them all to be the stars they wish to be, given that his dominance as star and producer could have eclipsed their performances. The almost whimsical way everyone participates in Rudy's dream creates a warm, energetic, smooth production.Although the bio could be accused of hitting the ""follow-your-dream"" theme too heavily, the story of this sometimes down-and -out record clerk is an inspiration for those who love the history of entertainment and may themselves dream of stardom. BTW: The period detail is worth seeing for itself.Dolemite Is My Name is a production of Netflix, which has become a major studio in a few years.

tt8526872,8,"Greetings again from the darkness. The old flea market adage is ""one person's trash is another's treasure"", and the same can be said for comedy. What you find obtuse and humorless may be the funniest thing your neighbor has ever seen or heard. No scientist can explain this phenomenon, and it's never been better exemplified than with a scene in director Craig Brewer's (BLACK SNAKE MOAN, HUSTLE & FLOW) latest film. Rudy Ray Moore and his group of friends are in a theatre watching Billy Wilder's comedy THE FRONT PAGE (1974), starring Walther Matthau and Jack Lemmon. The befuddled looks on the faces of Moore and his cohorts can't mask their confusion over the raucous laughter in the theatre and what they are viewing on screen. It's a turning point for Rudy Ray Moore and his next career step.Eddie Murphy stars as Rudy Ray Moore, and though it's not necessary, having some knowledge of the career of the real Mr. Moore will likely enhance your viewing experience during this exceedingly entertaining, and sometimes riotous biopic. Ruby Ray Moore was a hustler who dreamed of making it big in show business - first as a singer, then as a stand-up comedian, and finally as movie star. His ambition and dreams kept him going, even after others wrote him off. We first meet Rudy as an assistant manager at Dolphin's of Hollywood record store. He's trying to smooth-talk the store DJ (Snoop Dogg) into playing Rudy's R&B records ... one of which is ""The Ring-A-Ling-Dong"" song. The DJ tells him the time for that music has passed, but the next light bulb soon goes off Rudy. A local panhandler (a terrific Ron Cephus Jones cameo) regales those in the store with tall tales from the 'hood. Rudy decides to fine-tune those tales and turn it into a comedy act.Add some clothes and attitude and that's how Dolemite was born ... Rudy Ray Moore's onstage alter ego - part pimp, part rapping philosopher. His memorable catchphrase is repeated a few times throughout the film, and I'll do my best to present a PG version: ""Dolemite is my name, and 'effing' up mother-'effers' is my game."" Yep, now you have a better feel for Rudy and Dolemite. However, co-writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewsi (also co-writers on Tim Burton's ED WOOD, 1994), and especially Eddie Murphy, dig much deeper and provide a look at the man, his friends, and his career pursuits.It's pretty interesting to see a guy, without much going for him, figure out a strategy that ends up working. Part of his wisdom was in 'knowing his audience'. His own preferences, and those of his friends, played right into what went on stage, on vinyl, and on screen. When a producer tells him his act will only be funny to the 5 blocks in Rudy's neighborhood, Rudy brilliantly responds, ""Yeah, but every city in America has these same 5 blocks."" It's that kind of instinct, along with his generosity, and understanding his own shortcomings, that allowed him to reach a level of success. The scene where he cuts a deal with uppity actor D'Urville Martin (a superbly funny Wesley Snipes) portrays Rudy's keen sense of persuasion ... he played to the ego.Eddie Murphy reminds us of his immense comedic talents and how he became such a mega-superstar in the first place. Here, he's not really impersonating or mimicking Moore, but rather capturing his spirit and paying tribute to a man he so clearly respects. The supporting cast is also outstanding. In addition to Mr. Snipes, who we wish had more scenes with Mr. Murphy, Craig Robinson is hilarious as singer Ben Taylor, Keegan-Michael Key is socially-conscious playwright Jerry Jones, Titus Burgess is wide-eyed co-worker Theodore Toney, Mike Epps plays Moore's pal Jimmy Lynch, and Kodi Smit-McPhee (THE ROAD) plays the student-DP. In addition, we get a couple of other cameos from Chris Rock as DJ Daddy Fatts, and Bob Odenkirk plays a film distributor with dollar signs in his eyes. Deserving of special mention is Da'Vine Joy Randolph (""On Becoming a God in Central Florida"") as Lady Reed, Rudy's muse and discovery. She is funny and ferocious in this role that should lead to much more work.The film is produced by Netflix and it screened at the inaugural North Texas Film Festival. The music (Scott Bomar) and especially the costume design (Ruth Carter) are top notch, and contribute to the story and film. Rudy Ray Moore became a Blaxploitation icon at a time when the comedy of Richard Pryor, Red Foxx, and Moms Mabley were popular - so hopefully that gives you some indication of the type of humor the film delivers. Raunchy humor with Kung-Fu action and plenty of skin - that's the formula for the three Dolemite movies, as well as Moore's comedy albums (and their covers). This was a time when dropping Fred Williamson's name garnered instant respect. Some may compare this to James Franco's THE DISASTER ARTIST, but instead I recall Mario van Peebles' BAADASSSS!, a tribute to his filmmaking father Melvin. Hopefully your sense of humor will allow you to find the many laughs in this one, because Dolemite is dynamite ... and that' a WRAP!",Dolemite Is My Name,2019-10-25,7.3,54486,2019
tt8526872,NA,"Rudy Ray Moore (Eddie Murphy) was a true from the streets success. And, a late bloomer, as it were. After years of trying to breakthrough as an entertainer in L.A., the 40-something Moore took some stories he heard around his neighborhood and created the stand up comedian character of the cocky Dolemite. That act lead to underground success with self-released record albums and touring. With the Blacksploitation film genre exploding, it was only a matter of time until Dolemite hit the big screen.
Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski's script traces those crucial years in Moore's life in the early 70s. A raw, rude and raucous screenplay it is. Director Craig Brewer mostly keeps to the spirit of the writing and lets the dialogue and the acting take center stage.
And, with Eddie Murphy delivering a strong energetic performance, it's best to stand back and let him fly. And, soar he does. With the makeup, hair and some extra pounds, Murphy takes on the dynamo persona of Moore/Dolemite. Occasionally, Murphy is ""too good"" an actor to totally capture the rough hewn Moore, who was more a force of nature than a smooth performer -- but, it's hard to fault him for giving ""too good"" a performance! Wesley Snipes is almost unrecognizable as D'urville Martin, a ""name"" actor who Moore lures by letting him Direct. Kodi Smit-McPhee plays Nicholas Von Sternberg* Dolemite's cinematographer straight out of film school who leads a band of young white behind the scenes crew members. The real scene stealer is Da'Vine Joy Randolph as Lady Reed, a small town girl who Moore discovers on tour. The entire cast throws themselves into this with a verge and enthusiasm that is palpable.
The movie is a bit too long, with padded exposition and too close a fealty to the bio-pic template, but, as Dolemite himself might say: Who gives a $^@# about that!? You want action? You want laughs? You want some nasty?! We got it all!
Listen to Dolemite.
* Note: I've worked closely with Nick Von Sternberg, so yes, it's based on a true person. Very kind gentleman. Indeed, he is the son of master filmmaker Josef Von Sternberg (although he passed when Nick was still a teen).

tt8526872,9,"I've got to be honest here: I pretty much liked this movie before I even saw one frame. I love both ""Dolemite"" and movies about making movies. Combine that with an Eddie Murphy who actually gives a damn and you can't really do much wrong anymore.It's sad how the real Rudy Ray Moore never got to see this movie, because it's a great portrayal of what made him so endearing and likeable. Moore just never gave up and became a household name (well, a cult figure at least) against all odds. His movies just ooze a genuine love for film-making. ""Dolemite"" wasn't good on a technical level and the plot made no sense, but it gave the audience exactly what it wanted. Even decades later, it's one of the most genuinely entertaining movies ever made, without ever being in the same ballpark as competent. The boom mic is pretty much a supporting character, but that's all part of the charm.This movie was written by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, who also wrote the biopics about Ed Wood and Andy Kaufman (and also... ""Problem Child""?). They clearly know what they're doing and get their facts right, but it's the performances that really elevate this movie. It's not only Murphy. Wesley Snipes actually seems to be enjoying himself for the first time in years and steals every scene he's in. The cast gels together very well and all give believable performances.The only small downside is that the movie pretty much ends at the premiere of ""Dolemite"". Granted, that's a great climax for this movie, but there's so much more to the life of Rudy Ray Moore. He was actually quite successful for a couple of years after that, before losing everything on the commercial flop ""Disco Godfather"". Throughout the 1980s he pretty much disappeared, but his career had a revival when rappers started mentioning him as a great influence. Dolemite actually made a comeback in the early 2000s with ""The Return Of Dolemite"". It's a chapter worth exploring, but with so much source material I understand you have to make a selection.This movie has certainly revived Eddie Murphy's career, but more importantly it did the same for Rudy Ray Moore. Obviously, he's not around to enjoy it, but the Dolemite character is alive and well after more than four decades. Not bad at all for a movie that everybody tried to talk him out of. Rudy Ray Moore's story is an inspiration to all of us.",Dolemite Is My Name,2019-10-25,7.3,54486,2019
tt8526872,8,"""Dolemite Is My Name"" is a typical biopic bolstered by its implacable hilarity, its affection for its subject and its commitment to the time and place it is set. And yet, I'm still being nagged by something about his lead performance. Don't get me wrong, Murphy is very, very good, and I'd love to see him tackle Pryor next because of that. Just like Rudy Ray Moore, I buy him more than I do like Dolemite.That's probably the intention here, as Moore repeatedly says in the movie that the role is a put-on. That I keep rolling around in my head this performance says something about its staying power.Murphy isn't exactly the most charitable actor when he's the lead, a by-product of his star power, but he's here at its best when he's slyly letting the scene be stolen from below him.",Dolemite Is My Name,2019-10-25,7.3,54486,2019
tt8526872,9,"This is what the old timers call a ""feel good"" movie, and so do I as I am (sorta) old. Dolemite is My Name was awesome, and in particular a blast to see in a theater with a crowd that was into it (it's in select theaters two weeks ahead of its Netflix drop); in a lot of ways it's more like Scott/Larry's Ed Wood than The Disaster Artist, where once again we a determined and ultimately good-hearted underdog scrap his way into cult film status (in this case as much being a comedic powerhouse too, and showing for and outside and underrepresented community at the time). For all his faults, we root for Rudy Ray Moore, and it's practically without sentimental touches.I also didn't know much about the BTS stories of how Moore got his comedy shtick down (from homeless, hobos and other folks from the street), or how he put together his movie production through a lot of sheer will, determination, D'Urville Martin (ill get back to him in a second), and a few white guys from film school who could find a plug for the hotel used as ""Dolemite Studios."" Also, the heart of the movie including those around Rudy who helped him out, especially Lady Reed/Queen Bee (Randolph, who I haven't really seen before but is a stand-out), and writing (with Jerry Jones, Key is LOL) what he knew, and that connecting. The only thing missing is showing the boom mic dropping into the shots(!)This is amazing work, from writers who know how to do a story where outsider/down-on-their-luck/shut-out creators rise to the occasion in high comedic and dramatic form, and a director (Brewer, his first significant film since Black Snake Moan) who gets how to show black lives and how they matter. And Murphy is astonishingly good and charming and grounded and everything he needs to be to make Moore work... But goddamn if Snipes doesn't steal the whole show. This is the best character and most emotionally rich and fun Murphy's been in 20 years. This is the best Snipes has *ever* been (have I seen him be this funny aside from Major League? No. He's funnier here), as this completely full of himself star-director, drunk off his ass, and one step from directing with a pinky raised. And even he gets some dimension and a key moment where he gives Moore some advice/direction that connects genuinely.I may even raise this rating up a notch in the coming days. Im not sure, conventional ending besides, I can find a note wrong or off about Dolemite is my Name. This is the most heartwarming thing you may see this year - so strap in with some b****es and some beer! That's... The best I got.
... Pedantic point PS: the ""B***h, are you for real?!"" scene where Dolamite jumps out the window.... That's from the follow-up, The Human Tornado, not Dolemite proper (in a way that may be giving Martin too much credit that he could stage that).

All I can tell you is that whether or not Murphy went anywhere, he is back. This movie is some of Murphy's best work since he did standup comedy. He has matured amazingly well into a great actor and screen personality.His supporting cast here is amazing too. Its like he called up all of his friends and said ""Hey, lets make a movie"". Just like Rudy Ray Moore did in 1975 with the movie this movie is about. And it works very well.Comeback or not, this movie will mark the beginning of a new career for Eddie Murphy.

tt8526872,10,"Saw this with two other film buffs at our local indie theater to get a jump on the Netflix release, and we all enjoyed it a whole lot. Having been fans of Eddie Murphy from his earlier films and especially the way he carried SNL during the ""lean"" years, it was great to see him carry Dolemite is My Name.Rudy Ray Moore, a rather likable dude who tries to reinvent himself after failing in various entertainment projects, goes through an odyssey of sorts. It's ironic how this is the role in which Murphy is also reinventing himself. While many critics are expecting a Golden Globe nomination and quite possibly a win in the comedy/musical category for best actor, those of us who already love Murphy are not surprised that he could pull this off.Along the way, supporting characters (who are beyond the usual uni-dimensional ones seen in recent throw-away comedies), add a whole lot. Craig Robinson, Keegan-Michael Key, Wesley Snipes, Snoop Dog, Mike Epps and even Chris Rock are just great - yet Da'Vine Joy Randolph is probably the biggest surprise.It's also worth mentioning the historical context of this film. Although Blaxploitation films were already gathering steam at the time, Moore's projects were indie to the core, and show the roots of independent film. Similarly, we the audience are given an angle on performers who acted as precursors to the rap movement.Finally, the stylistic elements were superb in our opinion. The production designers nailed 1970's Los Angeles, costumes were fun, we thought the window into collaborating on films on a very thin budget was cool, the interspersed songs set the mood aptly, and the nudity/sexuality was presented in a fun (and funny) way. Despite the nostalgia aspects, the pacing/editing kept the film refreshing.With the exception of some smart independent comedies (eg., Edge of Seventeen, Eighth Grade) and outliers (such as The Favourite), comedies in the 2010's have really lost popularity and critical praise. Raunchy comedies have been losing money for years, perhaps because of the same tired in-your-face sight gags or poorly written stories that lack even a modicum of creativity. Many have not been grounded in relatable stories, so most of us just stopped going. Dolemite is My Name changes that. We expect it to be popular on Netflix, and can only hope that those making the next generation of comedies take notice. Bravo!",Dolemite Is My Name,2019-10-25,7.3,54486,2019

The real reason to watch this film is its overall message, to all beginning filmmakers and even people who just want to believe in themselves, that if you work your ass off you will accomplish what you have in mind.

tt6723592,10,"Hello again folks. I enjoy leaving reviews for these mind twisting movies. Here I will do my best and explain the timelines of the 4 major characters. All characters go through a RED timeline and a BLUE timeline. RED is moving forward and BLUE is moving backwards in the RED timeline. I hope that makes sense. Here we go!1) The Sator Timeline. When he's a young man he finds a box while working in Russia. The box contains gold and the BLUE technology. He's on a mission to find pieces for a doomsday devise that wipes out existence. The last piece he needs is missing. He threatens Kat's life with the Protagonist. He uses the Blue technology to recover the missing piece. He now has all the pieces for the doomsday device. He than goes back to the day on the yacht in the RED timeline. The day where Kat sees SOMEONE dive off the boat and says he disappeared.2) TheProtagonist timeline. After the opening opera scene he is tortured, passes a test, and is recruited. He learns of the BLUE technology. He gathers information to lead him down the path and finds the missing piece for Sator. After Kat gets shot he then uses BLUE technology so she can heal. She can heal in the BLUE timeline because she was shot with BLUE technology. Only way to come back to the RED timeline was through another BLUE and RED machine. Only one he has seen was at the airport. So the Protagonist must get them back to the RED timeline using the airport BLUE and RED machine. Protagonist then goes back to the day of the yacht in the RED timeline. Where they remove the doomsday device before the explosion.3) The Neil Timeline. Neil helps the Protagonist in the now RED timeline. Not Neil's RED timeline but the Protagonist's RED. They find what they need to find. After Kat gets shot he goes into the BLUE timeline and along to the airport to get her through the RED and BLUE machine. He then travels to the day of the yacht in the BLUE timeline. As he is in the cave he sees another BLUE and RED machine. Knowing that they caved in the tunnel with explosives he needs to be at multiple places at once. So he then travels again through the BLUE timeline to intercept the Protagonist's failure so the Protagonist does not fail. He gets killed in the process. Keep in mind that when he went through the BLUE twice one of his selfs had to go to the RED timeline. This is where he meets up with them at the end. This is where the Protagonist realized he's dead and it was him who saved him at the opera house in the beginning.4) The Kat timeline. When she meets the Protagonist in the movie it's in the RED timeline. She tells a story about the yacht and she see a woman dive off the boat, the woman diver is herself. Later, Kat gets held hostage by Sator in the RED timeline. Sator is in the same timeline but in BLUE. After the Protagonist saves her they are both captured. Protagonist captured in RED and Kat is captured in BLUE. After she gets shot she heals (Airport scene). She then heads to the day on the yacht in the RED timeline. She sees her past self leave the boat with her son and sees Sator leave in his helicopter. Ok this where it gets tricky... Sator comes back but it's not the RED Sator it's the BLUE Sator from the highway scene after he got all the pieces from the doomsday device. The RED Sator left and the BLUE came back in the RED timeline. She kills him. She always killed him. She said earlier at dinner with the Protagonist that she saw a woman dive off the boat and her husband had disappeared. She killed him and slid him off the boat with the lotion she put on his back.Whatever happened was always going to and did happen. Neil says that a few times. But it wasn't until the end where he says it doesn't mean you should sit around and do nothing about it. Kat always kills Sator that day, Neil always dies that day.I hope that clears up some confusions. I did my best without going into the smaller details. Please react if this was helpful or not. Thank you reading those that made it until the end.",Tenet,2020-09-03,7.5,314369,2020
tt6723592,8,"Its somewhat ironic that a movie about time travel can't be reviewed properly until your future self rewatches the movie.It's bold of Nolan to make such a thoroughly dense blockbuster. He assumes people will actually want to see Tenet more than once so they can understand it properly, which some may not. This movie makes the chronology of Inception look as simplistic as tic-tac-toe.Ergo, it's hard for me to give an accurate rating, without having seen it twice, as I'm still trying to figure out whether everything does indeed make sense. If it does, this movie is easily a 9 or 10. If it doesn't, it's a 6.It's further not helped by the fact that the dialogue in the first 15 minutes of the movie is painfully hard to understand / hear. Either they were behind masks; they were practically mumbling; the sound effects were too loud; or all of the above. The exposition scenes are also waayyy too brief for something this complex -- a problem also shared with Interstellar actually.(Interstellar had this minimalist exposition problem explaining Blight, where if you weren't careful, you'd miss this one sentence / scene in the entire movie explaining that Blight was a viral bacteria:""Earth's atmosphere is 80% nitrogen, we don't even breathe nitrogen. Blight does, and as it thrives, our air gets less and less oxygen"").I guess it's a Nolan quirk. Hopefully, a revision of the film audio sorts the sound mixing out. I do like the soundtrack, but it's too loud initially.I liked all the actors. You think John Washington can't act at first, but he can, and he grows on you as the film progresses. And Pattinson is his usual charming self. Elizabeth is a surprise treat. And so on.Its worth a watch either way. See it with subtitles if you can. And definitely don't expect to fully understand whats going on the first time around.",Tenet,2020-09-03,7.5,314369,2020

It might have been the cinema sound mix but my wife and I kept asking each other what they were saying.. the script was hard to hear let alone understand in its abstract form.. we got the gist of the concept but was still hard to piece everything together in the end!

What followed was two and a half hours of just an unreal amount of exposition that was distorted by music of SFX. If a film has to be explaining stuff to it's audience at the two hour mark then you've gone wrong. Plain and simple, I don't care if you're Christopher Nolan.Everyone I ask afterwards says that I will get it on the second, third or fourth try. Why does a film need multiple matches to understand it? Nolan is a huge advocate for his films to play in cinemas, which is great, but he must be detached from reality to think that most audience members can afford to go see the same film countless times, with the increasingly expensive movie tickets.Regardless of that, It's good that it was an original idea. But my god, if an unknown filmmaker had turned in this script to a production company, I'm pretty sure they would have thrown it away after 10 pages. The premise is cool, the effects are cool, but that is what you expect from a Nolan film. What I'm also coming to expect is a convoluted plot, terrible dialogue, and a film that will still hit over a billion at the box office.",Tenet,2020-09-03,7.5,314369,2020
tt6723592,9,"Its one hell of a complicated film. It will be very hard for an average viewer to gather all the information provided by this movie at the first watch. But the more you watch it, more hidden elements will come to light. And when you are able to put these hidden elements together. You will realize that this movie is just a ""masterpiece"" which takes the legacy of Christopher Nolan ForwardIf I talk about acting, Then I have to say that Robert Pattinson has really proved himself as a very good actor in these recent years. And I am sure his acting skills will increase with time. His performance is charming and very smooth. Whenever he is on the camera, he steals the focus
John David Washington is also fantastic in this movie. His performance is electrifying, I hope to see more from him in the future. Other characters such as Kenneth Branagh, Elizabeth, Himesh Patel, Dimple Kapadia, Clémence Poésy have also done quite well. And I dont think there is a need to talk about Michael CaineTalking about Music, its awesome. I dont think you will miss Hans Zimmer's score. Ludwig has done a sufficient job. There is no lack of good score in the movieGotta love the editing and post production which has been put into this movie. I think its fair to say this Nolan film has focused more in its post production.
The main problem in the movie is the sound mixing. Plot is already complex and some dialogues are very soft due to the high music score. It makes it harder to realize what is going on in the movie. Other Nolan movies had loud BGM too. But Audio and dialogues weren't a problemMy humble request to everyone is to please let the movie sink in your thoughts. Let your mind grasp all the elements of this movie. I am sure more people will find it better. Even those who think they got the plot. I can bet they are wrong.",Tenet,2020-09-03,7.5,314369,2020

tt6723592,6,Listen we all know Nolan swings for the fences of what's possible and pushes the realms of normality. This film for whatever reason just doesn't mesh together the way most of his films do even with complex suspension of disbelief aspects. It's often scattered and juxtaposed to a near outrageous level. The visuals are spectacular at times but also seem way too extravagant to take seriously other times. Robert Pattinson is flawless and probably the standout of the film with his vigorous performance. The same cannot be said about John David Washington's barren and emotionless lack of effort. I can't believe he was given the starring role. He brings the interest level down to almost unwatchable levels. Overall this is one of Nolan's rare misfires which he is capable of once in awhile.,Tenet,2020-09-03,7.5,314369,2020
tt6723592,5,"I am a big Nolan and Sci-Fi fan, and there's no question serious effort went into this movie. No question, the visuals were great, the acting was great, but the editing, PLOT and over-all effect was simply unsatisfying.The plot is full of discontinuity and random plot elements, and the main time reversal issue is never adequately explained, resolved or identified, and even the cryptic ""Tenet"" keyword never seems to appear outside of the trailer cuts. The most annoying aspect was the often incomprehensible audio, due to masks and bad editing, that made many key moments a total mystery.The plot is also littered with bad science of every possible kind, random statements that simply make no real sense (even using the odd time scenario) , and when viewed as ongoing story make you stop and say, how did we ever get HERE? The gun and bullet demonstration really sticks in my mind as total and complete cinematic plot garbage.I don't doubt this could have been a masterful movie, but unlike Memento or Inception, the script and story continuity were simply not up to the complex story task. The one word that sticks in my mind about this movie is disappointing. After the long delay, i really expected something a lot better than this. Maybe a later edit will fix this, but it certainly doesn't need to get any longer.",Tenet,2020-09-03,7.5,314369,2020
tt6723592,3,"On paper, Tenet should have been as good as Interstellar and Inception. There are definitely similarities between these Nolan films - which in itself is not a bad thing as you know you're in for a challenging interesting and visually amazing experience. But there are 3 differences between Tenet and those films:
1. The cast and performances in Tenet are weak, and you just don't care about any of them. Washington's character just wasn't interesting and was pretty boring. Basic film making = make characters you can care about.
2. The dialogue is fast and quiet (the background sound is way too dominant) so within the first 20 minutes you're already not following what's going on. It's not the viewers responsibility to watch a film 3 times because the sound production dept can't do their job.
3. Visually boring. There was a blandness about many of the sets. Remember the Japanese house at the start on Inception? And the ""sea world"" in Interstellar? Tenet lacks imagination and everything looks boring.
4. Complexity in itself doesn't make a film interesting. Tenet is just too complex and isn't worth it. It's a quzzle you don't care if you don't solve. There are lots of film that don't lay everything on a plate for the viewer (e.g. Enemy, 2001 Space Oddisy etc) but they're WORTH it.For the first time ever, I nearly walk out half way through. I endured to the end and was glad it was over.I'm genuinely surprised that there are so many 10/10 rating for this. I'm pretty good at following complex films but Tenet is just tediously complex.There are some good things about Tenet (Pattinson and Brannagh's performances), but overall, Tenet is poor.",Tenet,2020-09-03,7.5,314369,2020
tt6723592,5,"Big Nolan fan here. Doodlebug, Memento, The Prestige, Inception, Interstellar - all fresh and evocative stories. Needless to say, the bar was high going into Tenet.I had already seen the first ten minutes some months earlier in a preview which had left me enticed for more pieces of a seemingly new Nolan-y brainiac puzzle.Unfortunately, this movie feels like a self-parody.It starts off well enough, and the backward visuals look interesting enough, but gradually everything starts to feel very gimmicky. The ""message"" isn't revealed until somewhere around the last fifteen minutes, and mostly as a sort of parenthesis or footnote, and by then I had sat through two hours wondering who the enemy was, what they wanted and why I should care (Sorry, but WW3 is way too abstract a term for me. How? Over what? Why? What is at stake?). The explanation felt cliché and exploitatively woke-y. In the film, the last lines were treated as a thought entirely unique and amazingly deep. Wtf? Did a high schooler write this?The ""inversion"" part felt like an excuse to do cool visual stuff (which felt worn out very fast) instead of a basis for the exploration of a theme through story.The score felt intrusive, loud (my friend had to cover their ears in the cinema) and painfully on the nose. I bet a lot of the dissonant music came from some ""genius"" idea of playing melody backwards. Sorry, ranting a bit now, I digress...I watched my hope for a good story get crushed in non-stop action and chaos built around cardboard cut-out characters with no charm or personability. The actors seemed to be doing the best they could with what they had been given. The dialogue was, more often than not, laughable. Especially Debicki's character's lines were so cringe-y at times I could not believe what I was hearing.Glamorous environments, expensive clothing, global jet setting and VIPs carrying the fate of the world in their hands. Is this an attempt at trying to launch an updated modern Bond franchise?The film is competently made (cinematography, editing, production design etc), thus earning its five stars from me, but the story/execution is, I am sorry to say, sh**.This isn't a brainiac puzzle so much as a director lost very far up his own a**.

This movie showed promise the first twenty minutes and even though nothing made sense, there was still hope that it would all be tied together and all make sense. Unfortunately, hope was lost quickly and the plot disappeared into a endless past-future alternate reality abyss and never came back. This movie lacked depth and seemed pretentious from Nolan. A truly intellectual ""flex"" that surely he had no idea what was going on either.

Visually spectacular, but it falls way short on:General narrative and plot developmentCharacter development and any kind of emotional attachment to charactersPacing (It's ludicrously fast)Audio (Not sure what they did in post production to make it so bad but some dialogue scenes are almost incomprehensible).I felt angry watching the film, which is a first for me.

No character development what so ever.Sound mix was terrible, i couldn't hear half the dialogue, and the action scenes were stupidly loud, my mother was covering her ears and said it was actually painful.Critics are rating it purley because its the great Christopher Nolen, and they are scared they'd be seen as stupid if they said anything other that this is an amzing film. I am not a Nolen basher, i love literally every movie he has done, and was very excited to see this, most disappointed i have been since IT Chapter 2.",Tenet,2020-09-03,7.5,314369,2020
tt6723592,9,"As this will be non-spoiler, I can't say too much about the story. However, what I can is this: Tenet's story is quite dynamic in the sense that you won't understand it till it wants you to. So, for the first half, your brain is fighting for hints and pieces to puzzle together the story. It isn't until halfway through the movie that Tenet invites you to the fantastic storytelling by Christopher Nolan.Acting is beyond phenomenal, and I'd be genuinely surprised if neither Robert Pattinson nor John David Washington doesn't receive an Oscar nomination for best actor. It's also hard not to mention how good Elizabeth Debicki and Aaron Johnson both are. All around, great acting, and the dialogue amps up the quality of the movie.The idea of this movie is damn fascinating, and while there are films that explore time-travelling, there's never been anything quite like this. It has such a beautiful charm and for the most part, explains everything thoroughly. It feels so much more complex than any form of time-travelling we've seen, and no less could've been expected from Nolan.Oh my lord, the score for this film fits so perfectly. Every scene that's meant to feel intense was amped by a hundred because of how good the score was. Let me just say though, none of them will be found iconic, but they fit the story and scenes so well.In the end, I walked out, feeling very satisfied. Nevertheless, I do have issues with the film that I cannot really express without spoiling bits of the story. There are definitely little inconsistencies that I found myself uncovering as the story progressed. However, I only had one issue that I found impacted my enjoyment. That issue was understanding some of the dialogue. No, not in the sense that the movie is too complicated, but more that it was hard to make out was being said at times. It felt like the movie required subtitles, but that probably was because, at a time in the film, there was far too much exposition.Nevertheless, I loved this film, I'll be watching it at least two more times, and I think most of you in this group will enjoy it. I definitely suggest watching it in theatres if possible, just so you can get that excitement.(4/5) & (8.5/10) for those that care about number scores.",Tenet,2020-09-03,7.5,314369,2020

While he is trying to explain part of the plot to The Protagonist and to us as an audience, this is basically the whole movie, visually is great, the score even being loud is also great, the concept of moving backwards is also a great idea that give a lot great scenes, but when you stop to realize, a lot of things don't make a lot of sense.",Tenet,2020-09-03,7.5,314369,2020
tt6723592,1,"If you find movies with nameless characters pretentious, this will fit nicely into the pattern.Not only the protagonist is nameless, but he calls himself The Protagonist- how hilarious. ROFL. The Protagonist is the new James Bond, but not as funny. His story is a graceless mashup of Memento (reverse playing) + Inception (sharp-suited men moving in designer's environments) + Dunkirk (boys club of fighting and running around aimlessly).The Protagonist and his sidekick Neil also do a bit of time travel, to stop an evil - obviously Caucasian - enemy from destroying the world. Evil guy's name is Sator, and there's is also a firm called Rotas, somebody called Arepo and part of the plot takes place at the Opera.Once Nolan's done in trying to impress you with the Sator square, he adds the quantum arrow of time and reversing entropy, mixes it with the most banal female role you can imagine (a trophy, mistreated wife who loves her son very very much), a car chase, a couple of fist fights and an involuntarily hilarious and chaotic final scene involving a red and a blue team (Matrix anyone?).The ending involves a rip-off of Casablanca, with the two male heroes metaphorically kissing goodbye (or hello?) and more of The Protagonist being hyper cool.I understand Nolan likes 5 stars, slick hotels, luxury interior design, expensive suits and first class travel around the world. Also, he's not the sentimental type who can make you sympathise with his characters, but absolutely not giving a damn about any of them doesn't help enjoying this movie either, exactly because the plot is quite banal, but dressed up nicely with some smart - but condescending- gimmicks.",Tenet,2020-09-03,7.5,314369,2020

Accurate intelligence is about how self-aware you are with your intuition and how loving you are to yourself and existence. Therefore, if your behaviour isn't changing, then you're not growing. Some people are so focused on technical knowledge but lack the big picture, and because of this, they're emotionally unstable and stuck in life.

tt7126948,4,"The first one was fun and well played out. This sequel is a total misfire. Not because it follows the trend of having women being the alpha characters and portraying men as either weak or stupid, but simply because it's a lazy effort. Except a couple of scenes, and hilarious over-the-top acting by Pedro Pascal, I found nothing here. It has ""straight-to-DVD"" written all over it.",Wonder Woman 1984,2020-12-25,5.4,173666,2020
tt7126948,2,"Saw an advanced screening - this was the most excited I've been to see a movie in a very long time. It appears I'm in the minority who found it to be, frankly, terrible. While the performances of the leads were enjoyable, I found the movie's writing and direction so flawed as to be practically unwatchable.Gadot continues to embody WW laudably, if leaning at times toward overacting. Pine is effective as the ""fish out of water"" launched several decades into the future, even if some of his comedic moments with Gadot fall flat. Pascal plays a classically over-the-top 80's villain with enthusiasm - it seems he relishes every moment getting to play a bad guy. For me, Wiig gave the strongest performance of the first act - her comedic timing is given plenty of time to shine, and the audience has ample opportunity to empathize with her. Unfortunately, these four performances were not enough to dig this film out of the hole the writers created.Written with an over-inflated sense of self-importance, riddled with clunky dialogue trying desperately to convey depth and universal truths, the end result is an endless stream of cringeworthy, eye roll inducing lines that are so on the nose I wonder how they made it out of the writing room. At no point does the film treat its audience with intelligence, opting instead to spoon-feed every concept. How do they convey that WW is not only an action hero, but an advocate for the humanity in all of us? By forcing her to deliver gems like ""But Barbara, what about your warmth? What about your humanity?""Further issues, presented as they occur to me as I tire of reflecting on this mess:Why is the heist scene so intentionally campy? The movie is *set* in '84, not *made* in '84. Fortunately the remainder of the film abandons this style.Their *most* creative way to sell Barbara as awkward but likable is to have her drop her briefcase of papers? Couldn't come up with something original?All Smithsonian employees have access to an unguarded airfield? A WWII pilot can understand the controls?No fully-fueled fighter jet has a range to fly DC to Cairo.WW has only ever vanished a coffee mug in all her trying, but can suddenly vanish the jet ""because she must"".""I know we're racing against time to save the world, but let's go fly through some fireworks. It'll look cool, promise.""One moment WW can effortlessly sprint pushing a disabled armored vehicle down the road, the next she can't push two of them apart with all her might.The moment she rolls along the road with the two children in her arms is astonishingly poor CGI. Throughout the film, the most obviously CGI'd elements simply have no weight to them.Don't play the audio of Steve's ""how to fly"" speech over the moment WW takes it to heart and learns. Trust your actors and audience. Show, don't tell.Max didn't think to steal health in return for wishes until the end of the third act?Cheetah has practically zero screen time to pose a real threat. One fight and she's dealt with handily.Hundreds of nukes launched, and they don't vanish - they crumble in mid-air. This is somehow not a problem for the planet?Returned to the white house grounds, Max somehow lands within yards of his son who has been wandering abandoned highways?Linda Carter's cameo was *painful*. If she didn't actually smile and wink into the camera, it sure as hell felt like she did. I won't be re-watching to find out for sure.I'm tired of griping. I wanted so badly to like this continuation of the DCEU. I'll be there for the next one hoping for better, but my god was this a disappointment.

So many talented actors and so much wasted potential.So, because the script says so, Diana can make things disappear at will? She can swing from lighting with her lariat? She can block and catch bullets with her lariat? She can attach and swing from airplanes that are at cruising altitude while she's on the ground?! All of these exaggerated abilities while she's supposedly losing her powers? Another thing, her suit was supposed to be powerful, yet it crumbled like tinfoil during her five minute fight with Cheetah. What was the point of her wearing it then if she was back at full strength?Max Lord's character was laughable.

tt7126948,2,I have low expectations for DC movies. Some have delightfully surprised me. This falls flat on its face after 15-20 mins and never gets up...or even TRIES!! It felt rushed through production (definitely not in watch speed...). It was boring when their wasn't action and when the action started it was so fake it was distracting. Gadot and Pascal try and maybe have moments that don't suck. Wiig was...well exactly how you would expect her in an action film as a villain.To say the movie is disappointing is an understatement which is sad considering I had zero expectations going into it.

From the moment it starts it comes off almost as a parody. The open scene is very childish. Way too on the nose with its moralistic foreshadowing. The following failed heist is equally juvenile - taking place in a mall and is just plain silly. It's far from the grittier atmosphere that DC has been so good at recently.The interpretation of 80's culture is completely distracting and strips away any gravitas. Pedro Pascal comes off as laughable and inane. Wiig fairs no better and cannot pull off the baddie.It was hard to watch.

tt7126948,1,"I agree with the review ""utter disappointment"", I also read the Washington Post article. "" really getting to do whatever I wanted"" she said. And what a sad commentary that turned out to be. All of her characters, props and settings were ridiculous. Kristen Wiig injects one of her babbling SNL characters in her first scene. A super villian she's not, even for comic relief. And where is the strong empowered woman that encourages other women to use their own powers? Then there is that magic lasso, Diana might just as well sat and her desk in the museum and flicked it to and fro since it appeared to have an infinite length this time around. Placing the film in her memories of the '80s this might work for Coppola or Scorsese but one's sense of history needs to be able to look further into the past to develop a view. Was that President supposed to be Reagan, surely you could have found someone who actually resembled him. So much for '80s memories. The scenes of an injured and defeated WW were way to drawn out, and the computers of the day were only beginning to go beyond pixelated pictures. The technology of the day would not have been able to broadcast to the world. And Gal Gadots talents were never realized she just wasn't involved enough beyond window dressing, more attention was spent on the sets and locations. And what disappointment the release streaming and theatre distribution. Although I love theaters (I spent 35 yrsin the movie business) where I live they haven't reopened yet. THe streaming was terrible stop, stutter, freeze. fortunately the movie was so bad the pauses were a relief. I wonder what Bill Diehl or Roger Ebert would have had to say about WW84?

I did love the opening island scene where the girl actress playing the young Diana was superb, and apparently did all her non-cgi stunts. But then it went downhill faster than an illiterate skier passing a 'Warning - cliff ahead' sign.

tt8936646,8,Finally Netflix has finally produced a action movie that is fast pace. Chris Hemsworth does not disappoint at all.,Extraction,2020-04-24,6.7,162645,2020
tt8936646,NA,"""Extraction"" is fast, vicious and simple. With a death count that's approaching John Wick 3 levels of bullet ballet, the movie hardly pauses for breath.Chris Hemsworth is excellent as the haunted mercenary Tyler Rake. This is a very physical role and Hemsworth delivers in spades.8 out of 10.",Extraction,2020-04-24,6.7,162645,2020
tt8936646,7,"The action scenes are really good. Close combat with extremely long shots in tight spaces. Sometimes it has a shooter video game feel to it. Hemsworth and the stunt team really showed of their skills. This movie is really more about close combat scenes, than crazy Hollywood stunts a la mission Impossible. Other than that, all the story is already in the title, which is fine for this type of movie. The actor, who played the boy was a wonderful casting choice. He was carrying the whole emotion of story. We'll be seeing more of him. Other characters were not drawn out. This movie is not for everyone, it is not well rounded, it's all action and no story. I personally enjoyed it though. I recommend this for viewers that like close combat action and martial arts movies.",Extraction,2020-04-24,6.7,162645,2020
tt8936646,9,"Negative reviews have focused on the alleged shortfall in the depth of the plot. Really? Most action movies out there... how many have a plausible plot? At least for this movie, the plot is plausible, the action, obviously a stretch. But those critics railing on the movie forget what a movie is supposed to be all about. Entertainment. It's not a real life documentary, not an ensemble boring drama piece. When it comes to wham-bang entertainment, this movie delivers on all cylinders. The movie is probably more analogous to a version of masterful The Raid than an Oscar drama piece. Live with it. Watch it. Enjoy. It is a movie. It will keep you glued. Though the squeamish may need to take a break.",Extraction,2020-04-24,6.7,162645,2020
tt8936646,7,"I'm not much of a writer, so I'll keep the review short.The plot is nothing new, but is interesting enough. However, Chris Hemsworth knocks it out the park with his performance - I really didn't expect that from him, but he is awesome in this.The action scenes are great, and some of the camera work and filming techniques are fantastic.The film is a 6/10, but I gave it a 7/10 for the action scenes and Hemsworth's performance.",Extraction,2020-04-24,6.7,162645,2020
tt8936646,9,"What a rush. What a thrill. What poetic violence.After movies like this, ""6 Underground,"" ""Ronin,"" and others, can we please have more movies set in foreign countries? Let's break away from the monotony of New York, L.A., and Chicago and go international: Mumbai, Tokyo, Lagos.The premise of the movie is simple and it's all in the title. A skilled mercenary named Tyler (Chris Hemsworth) has been contracted to extract a drug dealer's kidnapped son. It's pretty much a suicide mission, but Tyler didn't need even the slightest coaxing to take the job. He didn't even ask the price. Some odd hours later he's in Bangladesh, kid in tow, shooting his way out of a sticky situation.This ballsy grimy film took you through the muck in style. The camera angles and continuous action shots were fresh as it followed Tyler from one point to the next while he shot and fought John Wick style to his extraction point. ""Extraction"" was raw at times, shocking at other times, and even moving at times. It's a no frills visceral form of action that keeps you at the edge of your seat and constantly engaged. Ooooh! give me more.",Extraction,2020-04-24,6.7,162645,2020
tt8936646,7,"In a world that is currently minus new films, to get a fresh one delivered to us via Netflix was a much needed treat. And I'm glad to report that 'Extraction' was worth the wait. It isn't a flawless movie, but it certainly has some good things going for it. The action sequences were probably the highlight of the film for me. I'm not usually someone who appreciates or even notices good action sequences, but I did with this film which says something. There is one sequence that really blew me away. It is a one-shot sequence that goes on for quite some time and has some amazing ingenuity behind it. Definitely the highlight of the film.Chris Hemsworth was right at home in this role. He doesn't have to do a lot of speaking, and can just let his actions speak for themselves. Some of the stunt work in this film would not have been easy. When he is required to slow things down and have some dialogue in the odd scene he does so adequately.The film surprised me with just how violent it was willing to be at times, especially in scenes involving children. There were a couple of time where I thought - they're not going to do that are they? - and then sure enough they did. This is a very serious film as well. Very little (if any that I can think of) humour whatsoever makes an appearance.The film does get a little tedious towards the end. You can only watch so many people getting shot without becoming numb and a little bored by it. Also the film opens with a shot from near the end of the film. It doesn't work though because there is no intrigue behind it. This was one of the few poor choices an otherwise very good film made however. I would recommend giving this one a watch.",Extraction,2020-04-24,6.7,162645,2020
tt8936646,6,"The entire movie is filled with close combat shots. It's great for someone who likes a lot of actions but for someone like who looks for a story in movies, I had a hard time trying to grasp this movie.
It literally shows a poor country like Bangladesh lost thousands of its elite force, a general and dispersed an entire city just to support a gangster and save his kidnapped boy from escaping. Looks like Bangladesh went into an entire war to help the gangster no matter what.
Just leave that logic aside and you can enjoy the movie as a fast paced, action packed video game.",Extraction,2020-04-24,6.7,162645,2020
tt8936646,7,"I am Bangladeshi. But I know this movie was not made with our culture. But Hindi songs go from house to house in Bangladesh! What an awkward thing! Then writing Hindi on the street, Hindi pronunciation in every word, what are these? Learning from Kolkata, if Dhaka is named, then this is the situation! The job of a director and team is to check and select well. They have lost completely. But the actions of this movie were extraordinary. chris and randeep have done a great job.I know an action movie doesn't represent culture, but the movie is criticized for its lack of analysis by the director and the team. A little better analysis was needed, because here the names of the russo brothers are involved. And i love russo brothers and chris my thor so much....",Extraction,2020-04-24,6.7,162645,2020
tt8936646,9,"Impressive camera work and action sequence. All the actors did a great job in making this film very entertaining. The fight scenes are great, the knife fights are authentic and the shoot out was exhilarating. I guess my only critic on this is the plot perhaps a different twist about who the boy was would have made it more interesting but nevertheless an awesome action film overall. Again hats off to the camera work, fantastic job!",Extraction,2020-04-24,6.7,162645,2020
tt8936646,8,"Now, it's not a greate movie nor is it a bad movie, it's somewhere in between. I mean the stunt work is really, really great, and the protagonist does have his moments of weakness, and it has that kind of action you come to expect from action movies today (one man against the whole world) but i bet that there was someone working on that movie that had millitary expirience.. One of rare movies in which the guy actually checks to see if the gun has bullets when he steals it, actually counting bullets in a magazine or having an empty gun or chamber...
Yes the movie has poor CGI, too much yellow color grading and unrealistic shooting and fighting scenes but it still has it's moments of actual care for the character even though it's not as developed.",Extraction,2020-04-24,6.7,162645,2020
tt8936646,7,"Extraction is a fun and average action flick that has awesome action, good performances, and a totally ""meh"" plot. But hey, this is exactly what Netflix is for and I'm totally okay with that.",Extraction,2020-04-24,6.7,162645,2020
tt8936646,7,"Extraction stars Chris Hemsworth and was produced by the Russo brothers. It was directed by Sam Hargrave in his directorial debut. He has previously made a career as a stuntman, most notably as a stunt coordinator in several Marvel movies. And that definitely shows in the film. This film contains some of the nicest action set pieces seen in years.Unfortunately, this comes at a price. Namely that of an interesting story. While the story of Extraction - a gun for hire (Hemsworth) shooting his way through Bangladesh in order to rescue the kidnapped son of a drug lord - is perfectly serviceable, it's also nothing to write home about. The characters are shallowly written and while they're acted well enough, the main attraction of the film are those action scenes.That being said, those are definitely good enough on their own to justify the price of admission. Hemsworth gives an electrifying performance as a man spread too thin by all the violence he has caused, while Randeep Hooda gives an equally memorable performance as his foil and counterpart.And it's just plain fun to watch. If you have a soft spot for those 80s action films such as Commando or Rambo, then this is definitely worth checking out.",Extraction,2020-04-24,6.7,162645,2020
tt8936646,5,"The premise of the movie was supposed to set in Dhaka, a city of 10+ million people in Bangladesh. Unfortunately, they completely missed mark making the set in Dhaka.To start with, the accent of the locals are wrong, they are speaking in an accent that's commonly used in West Bengal, India. Dhaka and People in Bangladesh, in General, have a completely different accent. Throughout the movie, Hindi songs are heard in the background, where everyone is watching tv during midday. People go to work here, Dhaka is the capital, nobody sits on their asses watching TV midday. Bangladesh has its own music industry, although the movie had some issues acquiring copyright for some of the songs to play in the background.The environment is wrong. Sure Dhaka has slums and dirty places, but most of the city is developed enough with an actual nice road system. If they set the scene somewhere else in Bangladesh, it would've been more convincing. The roads are basically dirt roads in this movie where Dhaka has one of the best road systems in the Country. Dhaka doesn't have that kinda dense jungle anywhere near the city, certainly not near the Buriganga river.The criminal class in Bangladesh is completely different. This isn't Africa, people don't employ child soldiers here. And certainly carry Ak-47 in hand and in the open.The Police uniform and looks are completely misjudged. They are trying to portray the elite force of Bangladesh, Known as Rapid Action Battalion. They are not regular police. The deal with counter-terrorism and similar stuff. It should've been the police that deals with criminal or action in the street. Police vehicles are wrong.Don't get me wrong, the entire movie is brilliantly shot and exceptionally action-packed. But this provides a complete misrepresentation of Bangladesh, as well as the city of Dhaka. People who don't have an idea about Bangladesh will get a false sense for a beautiful country by the misrepresented set of this movie.",Extraction,2020-04-24,6.7,162645,2020

tt8936646,7,"The latest Netflix original film to arrive on the streaming service. Extraction sees Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth), a black market mercenary, embark on the most deadly extraction of his career when he's enlisted to rescue the kidnapped son (Rudhraksh Jaiswal) of an imprisoned international crime lord.As much as their originals are hit and miss and the sheer amount of content they release being ridiculous, there is no question that Netflix allow pure filmmaker freedom without the restrictions and interference of Hollywood influence as here the film is allowed to make full use of its 18 rating and not have the burden of setting up or continuing a franchise. Though generic and cliche in its story telling, the action and stunt work are an absolute blast to witness and make this a step up from what I was expecting.The film's 2 hour runtime may have some filler sequences around the middle section, but the 1st and 3rd acts are fast paced and frantic, throwing you right into the situation, the film knows exactly what it wants and sets out to deliver it. The race against time and constant improvisation of the extraction itself makes for a consistently engaging watch, though the film does brush over motivations (the villain here is especially lacklustre) and character back story, with Tyler solely relying on a few flashbacks and essentially an exposition interview with the kid he is protecting, so that we get more of his story.However what this basic premise does allow for is to be filled with brutal, well choreographed and creative action. This film delivers one of the best set pieces of this year, with a phenomenal one-take style 15 minute sequence, which goes from a car chase, to a building assault to a lorry chase, it's absolute controlled chaos. As a fan of John Wick, The Raid etc. it was excellent to see their influence on the choreography, the camerawork never is too shaky or quick cutting meaning it is easy to follow and witness every stab, punch, kick in their bone crunching and visceral glory. The shootouts sound great and are intense, always ending in bloody results, especially the finale sequence.It's good seeing Hemsworth in a grittier, darker non-Thor/MIB role and he delivers here in a more somber and focused role, though also channels some of the action hero vibe of the 80/90's that this film is going for. Jaiswal is also good here as the kid thrown into this life or death situation, he is never irritating or acts unrealistically at all (which is the case with kids in these types of films at times). Randeep Hooda has an intimidating screen presence as someone working for the kid's father and David Harbour gives an enthusiastic performance, though his character's section does stall the plot pacing.Extraction is a fun watch to turn your brain off for 2 hours and was actually better than I expected. The action is bloody, visceral and frantic with some brilliant practical effects and choreography and the cast give good performances. The film does suffer from several cliches and genre traits and lack of character depth, but honestly from a purely entertainment perspective this does the job.",Extraction,2020-04-24,6.7,162645,2020
tt8936646,9,"Thoroughly enjoyed this film - weak storyline but it's totally forgiven because of its brilliant action and the camera work on it is a thing of beauty.
you're glued to the car chases and fights to the point where you feel you should be smelling the exhaust fumes and that if you don't dodge out the way you're going to get a smack in the mouth or shot.
The Director could do a James Bond film no problem.
it's got the rawness of action that's needed",Extraction,2020-04-24,6.7,162645,2020
tt8936646,9,"Wow shocked at the undeserving low score! This is stunt actor Sam Hargrave's first full length feature film sitting in the directors chair, and he nailed it. Outstanding action/fight choreography, great cinematography, perfect pacing for the 116 min runtime, and all around great performances, especially Hemsworth's kick-ass character. I'm reading the reviews about no plot... seriously? Just because there's no surprising unpredictable plot twist doesn't mean there's no plot. It was a simple story, adapted into a screenplay from the graphic novel by Ande Parks, and presented on a bullet ridden testosterone plate. What more does anyone want for that perfect weekend popcorn action flick? I thoroughly enjoyed it! It's a well deserved 9/10 from me.

tt7846844,6,"Enola Holmes is absolutely wonderful, quirky and charming. You'll absolutely love it, unless you're a Sherlock Holmes fan, then it quickly looses its charms. They basically change every character completely to fit the story, rendering them unrecognisable. But, it's made for young teen girls and they will love it. I should also add, that Henry Cavill is one of the worst Sherlock Holmes, I've ever seen. I genuinely like him as an actor, but in this case I think he was terribly miscast.If you love Sherlock Holmes, you won't love this... but if you don't care about Holmes you'll have a great time.",Enola Holmes,2020-09-23,6.6,130764,2020
tt7846844,5,"Interesting premise, interesting setting, good actors, terrible writing.
The plot is all over the place.The main character verges on being a ""perfect, but boring"" character. Why are male characters belittled in order to elevate the female ones? Just write them all better instead of doing it this lazy way.Events happen in ways that dont make sense and for no reason other than that the plot demands it.I know this isn't a historical drama and I'm ok to suspend disbelief with a bit of artistic license, but the historical inaccuracies going on are so glaring it removes the viewer from the story entirely. It is made so much worse by sticking ""modern-acting"" characters in a society where such acts would be so out of place.Nothing wrong with a theme of feminism, but it is poor writing to shove the theme in our face every minute. The theme should speak through the actions of the characters, not them telling it to your face while looking at the camera.",Enola Holmes,2020-09-23,6.6,130764,2020
tt7846844,5,"It sort of tries to be too many things at once.You think it's going to puzzle your brain a lot based on how things are set up, but it doesn't.There're commentaries on oppression and class/privilege differences thrown in there, which were alright, but sometimes annoying.There's a little love story thrown in there too, which is kind of unnecessary. It does get woven into the story and messages, but it's a bit hit and miss.Conceptually good, and well acted. But the execution needs some work.",Enola Holmes,2020-09-23,6.6,130764,2020
tt7846844,6,"For the other reviewers that stated things like female Jiu-Jitsu classes were unheard off and it ruins the ""period films"", are just wrong.

tt7846844,2,"I really wanted to love this movie.I'm the father of a 10-year old girl, and I firmly believe that we need more cool, smart, brave young female leads in movies, so that smart, cool, brave girls like my daughter has someone to look up to.So I was looking forward to seeing a clever young girl solving a difficult puzzle in a movie with subtle references to the old Holmes-stories.I did not get that at all.The premise of this story is that the mother of Enola, Sherlock and Mycroft disappears and leaves behind clues to where she is hiding.Apparantly, Henry Cavill's Sherlock can't be bothered to solve this rather simple paint-by-numbers case, so Enola steps in, but before the case really kicks off, our lead character meets a young viscount on the run, and the story turns into a YA love story instead.Apart from the lack of a good puzzle, the main problem with the movie is that it talks down to its audience. Instead of just showing us some strong female characters (and there are a lot of them in this movie, so that's great) it insists on constantly telling us that ""the world is changing"" and ""you can choose your own path in life"". These not-so-subtle messages are sometimes even narrated directly to the viewer by the main character.The old saying ""don't tell it, show it"" doesn't seem to be something the film makers have ever heard of.",Enola Holmes,2020-09-23,6.6,130764,2020

tt7846844,9,"I've seen many people have disliked the film because of ""historical inaccuracies"" and it's feminist ideas. I must respectfully say, as much as I respect your opinions, you've missed the point of the film entirely.Enola Holmes was not intended to be a masterpiece by Scorsese/Tarantino/James Cameron/Peter Jackson/Spielberg/Nolan et cetera et cetera and leave you with a powerful message or a million questions. This is supposed to be a fun family action/mystery for people of all ages to enjoy, with a hint of that familiar character that is the iconic detective of Baker Street. The film succeeded in its aims to be fun, a film to watch with others to unwind after a long day and forget about life. This film, along with a great story and stellar cast led by the always spectacular Miss Millie Bobby Brown, is exactly what this world needs at this moment in time.The aforementioned cast did brilliantly in their roles. MiIlie Bobby Brown pulls the character off excellently, managing to be a perfect blend of Sherlock and a regular teenage girl, creating a fantastic original character. Cavill and Claflin were exceedingly good (and at some points rather humorous) in their roles of the Holmes brothers and Helena Bonham Carter brings her usual brilliance to the table in her role. The film itself is fantastic, managing to entertain whilst working in the underlying subplot and message of women's rights.I'd highly suggest watching this film and if my argument hasn't persuaded you, let me ask you this; why do we go to the cinema but to be entertained?",Enola Holmes,2020-09-23,6.6,130764,2020
tt7846844,5,"Without much of a mystery to solve, this young Holmes comes across more like a junior-level Wonder Woman: intelligent and highly trained yet puzzled by this unfamiliar, unfair world of men.The movie was less intriguing with no high level mystery whatsoever.

We should expand our perception of how an intelligent person behaves, speaks, and looks. Being unfeeling, being a sociopath, and being hooked on cocaine, should not be (and certainly isn't the case in the real world) identifiers for a genius person.
Normally, I don't like films that hit you over the head with the feminist message--because it normally isn't done well. This time it's part of the character, it's a developed concept, and it's a developed narrative. Relax. No reason to get heated. Just enjoy it. A solid Netflix release.

Again, if the intention is to ""borrow"" the fame of Doyle's character, then the film maker should not direct the intelligence of the viewer.Finally, even if this were completely detached from the Sherlock Holmes' universe, I think it's still a failed attempt to #metoo and ""live your life"" movement.

tt7846844,2,"At first, I was quite excited when I noticed a new Holmes movie on Netflix. At first glance it seemed like great flick: A-list cast, centered around a great mystery and lovely decor. I didn't mind at all that the movie was centered around Sherlock's less well known sister Enola, and that the movie had some sort of feministic background.However, as the movie progressed, the latter became obvious to a point where it became very annoying and the movie itself, for it's time period, unrealistic (for example, a secret all-women jiu jitsu class in the early 1900s? Yeah, sure). All other classes, races and genders in the movie seem to have no troubles or problems at all, only the wonen. which at the time was certainly not the case.Also, as is unfortunately the case with many #metoo pleasing movies nowadays, the male characters were all either evil, bumbling idiots, or completely helpless with the sole exception of Sherlock Holmes, who doesn't get much screen time.Don't get me wrong, I love many movies with female lead characters (underworld, pan's labyrinth, resident evil, etc). I just really dislike this current wave of overcompensated feminist-focused movies that keep using the same old formula, and forget that there was actually supposed to be a decent plotline in the movie. Too bad, it could have been so much more..",Enola Holmes,2020-09-23,6.6,130764,2020
tt7846844,NA,"Annoying AF, and badly written. The constant 4th-Wall breaks by Enola destroys the narrative, the pace, it's condescending, and becomes annoying, irritating.But the worst sin of the movie is characterization. Whoever wrote this has no understanding of Mycroft Holmes (here an insufferable chauvinist petit-maître millions of miles away from the understated genius, government superagent of the Conan Doyle books) and to add insult to injury, the characterization of Sherlock Holmes himself, despite the books, plays, movies and tv shows who clearly show what kind of character he is, his personality, and so on. Having Henry Cavill miscast as a sympathetic, charismatic, friendly, brotherly, caring Holmes is an irony in itself, after his utterly misguided casting as Superman, whom he played as depressive, brooding, uncharismatic emo dull bore that ruined that other classic franchise for years to come. He seems to be condemned to always miss the mark as an actor thanks to awful scriptwriters and poor characterization.A lot of chauvinists are giving low ratings to the movie because it's allegedly ""feminist"", but that's also far from the fact of why this movie fails, since it also lacks a mature and nuanced understanding of what feminism is.",Enola Holmes,2020-09-23,6.6,130764,2020

tt7846844,1,"I really hoped for a fun and chill adventure movie to just kick back and relax. The first thing that turned me off was the way the narrative is handled - Enola talking to the screen/viewer and explaining every smallest detail left no field for any mind excercise. I just felt like the director thinks I'm too dumb to understand most basic concepts. The second and perhaps a key issue with the movie is it's aggresive use of 'so called' feminism. Being aggressive towards men, constantly telling them that they are useless is not an act of strength, but of weakness. Is this the message we want to convey to our youth? That in order to be a strong woman you must believe that men are somewhat of a lesser being? Think no need to say that such a portrial of the main characters has little to do with any historical relevance. But this part I can forgive, as it is supposed to be just a simple 'feel good' movie. However, I cannot stand by the direction the movie takes with toxic form of feminism. True strength of a woman is in her kindness, empathy, love and care for others.

The effects are all good and have grit.My mind kept referring back to Austin Powers. The baddie is that comical (but not in a funny way). The plot is childlike and felt very amateur.

Making no sense whatsoever. This quality of story telling is very poor considering who is in the film.Overall, a promising film that immediately failed to deliver anything other that a straight to VHS Sunday story.

They managed to make the characters relatable and add meaning to the story.1-1 fighting was choreographed beautifully, even though some scenes felt cliché.I was hoping for a more layered villain, just for balance. The 5 were not pure good so why would he be pure evil?

Its main take no nonsense lady, man, man, man and new girl. They are complete characters descriptions of the main cast. Charlize's characters is more developed with a deeper backstory but the others are so interchangeable and forgettable.The action scenes are well choreographed but I found the sound effects a bit too much like every time a sword or axe was used it would make a cartoon ""swoosh"" sound which I get it but I think it could have been tone down a little bit.It's not like terrible and you could probably watch it if you are really board but I wouldn't carve out 2 hours to watch it.Oh yeah it's 2 hours 5 minutes long which is too long and definitely has scenes that could have been left on the cutting room floor to tighten it up.",The Old Guard,2020-07-10,6.6,130667,2020

tt4566758,1,"This is probably the worst movie I have seen in the last two years. And mind that Mulan still is one of my favourite cartoon movie, so thats quite something to achieve.Let me put it simple, every time the script diverged from the cartoon it was for the worst. They left out the best parts and added the most ridiculous nonsense you can imagine.
The Witch: Why add this character? How lazy do you have to be as a screenwriter to only be able to make the story ""work"" by adding a character that can morph into any other character? Betrayal? Complicated motives? Multilayered characters? No - it was just the witch who took over the Kings servant.The Phoenix: Absolutely useless trope. I would argue that the story of Mushu in the cartoon was written better that the whole Mulan 2020 script. This dumb phoenix from the ashes metaphor has been done a thousand times, please for gods sake can these people have one original idea?Loyal, brave, and true. These three words appear like 10 Times through the movie yet absolutely nothing comes from it that wouldn't naturally appear in a Mulan story. Its like making a Harry Potter movie and have the word ""Magic"" appear on every item. Yeah we know, it's a movie about bravery - we have all seen the cartoon.Scenery: The landscapes are beautiful, if this would be a documentary. Did anyone tell the director that the landscapes in a movie need to make sense? I felt like I'm watching an old spice comercial: I'm on top of a mountain, now I'm in the desert, look back to me I am now inside a vulcano.In Summary the movie had three very strong virtues. But I'm not talking about ""loyal, brave, and true"" the three words that come to my mind are ""ridiculous, dumb and lazy"". So yeah, don't watch, don't buy. Just watch the cartoon another time.",Mulan,2020-09-04,5.6,115044,2020
tt4566758,3,"""Do you believe they are actually picking a Chinese girl to play the role as Mulan in the new real-person Disney remake movie?""
I can still remember the question from an ABC girl and the excitement on her face when she was asking the question back in 2017. And after all these years of waiting, it turns out to be a complete disappointment.A 3-star is probably the best rating that I can give here.
Yifei Liu is absolutely the ideal cast for the character of Mulan. It looks astonishing on that reflection of Mulan in the sword poster. And that wins the movie one of the stars.
Some of the scenery in the movie are beautiful especially with IMAX 3D. Mountains and skyline of the capital city are breathtaking, which earns the second star. It is probably a half star if not with IMAX.
As for the third, since IMDB won't allow me to give a ZERO star for the worst movie of all time, it is basically a buy-2-and-get-1-for-free star.Mulan's story has been told to all the Chinese of their childhood for over a thousand years. And thanks for Disney, the story is told to all the world with their great cartoon movie in 1998. The spirit of Mulan has been encouraging generations of people, including her bravery, loyalty and most importantly her filial responsibility. (Well, that's true, Chinese people thinks highly of their filial duty.)
However, all the spirits above are but of words engraved on the sword, and the director really wants to tell that little story about a girl seeking for her true-self, which could be any other story but Mulan's. Despite of that, the whole story line is not logical, well, at all.
* Avoiding to face the true-self as a female? Is that true?
* Hiding family Kungfu from the troop? Is that necessary?
* Taking off all armor and helmet to run for a war fight? Cannot be more logical.
* A troop of well trained soldiers counting the Emperor's life on and only on a little girl? Best strategy ever.
* Such an easily provoked Emperor that would rather get himself into a one on one fight to a berserker? Trump wouldn't do that for sure.If you want to make a good Chinese history based movie, the least thing you have to do is to do some real study on it.
But all I can see from this movie is prejudice from westerners to Chinese traditional culture and a soulless Disney drama.
* Praying to phoenix for safety and peace? We don't ever do that in China.
* Concubines with pale white faces and bloody red cheek makeups? That's what Japanese Geishas do.
* A mind-controlling or transforming witch? Okay, Valar Morghulis.
* Phoenix Vs Eagle metaphor? What's that for?
Basically, not a single culture is presented precisely from where they come in this movie.
If you can read Chinese, you can learn more mistakes that are made about the culture, history timelines, etc, where the ratings goes all the way down to 4.9 after 3 days of the release.
If you can't, don't bother, and just remember the mistakes are much more than you can even imagine.
The director successfully made a contribution to alienate the understanding between the westerners and Chinese.
Westerners may think this another movie that is made for Chinese in order to please the Chinese market, while Chinese people are actually feeling INSULTED by all these cultural bias.
Niki Caro shows us a great example how to make a movie and offend both side of the audience.In the original Mulan folklore, there are no characters like Mushu, the cricket, and all the funny souls of ancestors. But who would possibly complain about a cute funny dragon especially when it comes from Disney? But when a silent, helpless and do-not-know-what-to-do phoenix is taking Mushu's place, it just let people doubt if this 2020 remake is actually a Disney movie.
Besides, Mulan is made a superhero with great talent when she was very young. And of course, a heroine cannot have a boyfriend, potential one, as a general or something. That adaption sounds not feminist at all.All in all, this movie is simply a waste of a good legend, passion from Disney fans, 2 hours of your life probably, and above all, 200 million dollars.

All that mattered to him was that she was responsible for destroying his army and he took her as seriously as any other enemy.

I love the first Mulan movie and in fact Mulan is one of my favorite Disney characters. I still sing songs from that movie to my children each night. But if I wanted to watch Mulan (1998), I would just watch the original.This movie is not meant to be a re-make, it is meant to be a re-imagining of a deeper story. A legend. A story about a woman who wants to be TRUE to herself but still respectful of her family, her culture, and her country. I think that the comedic relief of the Mushu character would have taken away from the important message that we can all stand to learn from this legend. Mulan learns that what she has within her is NOT something to be hidden away, but a gift that she can share with the world. I also thought the score of this movie was beautiful and the subtle references to the original brought tears to my eyes.If you want to watch Mulan (1998), then watch that movie and don't pay the $29.99 to watch this movie.

Sometimes they have lame fighting styles, other times they just randomly throw in something out of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, and not in a good way, but it's all really boring. They also took out all the interesting characters, like Mushu, Shang, Cricket, Mulan's grandmother, Mulan's 3 army friends, and instead we get these pointless nobodies who have little to no role other than simply being there. They even gave Mulan a sister, but she adds absolutely nothing; you can take her out of the movie and it changes nothing. Oh, and there's no Shan Yu either, instead we get these two generic, boring villains with no character. And let's not forget the inclusion of chi and actual magic and witchcraft. And, of course, Mulan is an overpowered Mary Sue who, even as a child, was performing moves that would put Jackie Chan to shame. I mean, why not give her actual development in training and stuff to show her becoming a good fighter when you can just make her super OP Mary Sue right off the bat, right? The acting itself is bland, and even the dialogue is horrible. Everyone talks in these tone-deaf monotone voices with no emotion in them. You really feel nothing for any these characters. The movie has none of the charm of the original, and they don't even have any of the songs. Seriously, the movie is an utter disaster, and completely boring. They would have been better off doing a shot-for-shot remake like they did with the live-action Lion King.

Just colorful CGI and wrap it up and throw it out there as people eats everything big companies throw at them.

tt4566758,7,"This movie is very different to the animated film: there's no singing; there's no Mushu; there are lots of typical Chinese martial art action scenes (i.e. people running straight up walls/basically flying); there's a new villain; the ending is different.... And that's okay. Stories don't all have to be told in the same way. Sorry that you might be upset about that. Here is a review of the film from someone who isn't heartbroken that it's not identical to the animated movie. (Seems like I am one of the only people here who thinks that way.)IMO, live-action Disney adaptations that follow the animated version frame by frame are boring as hell because you know what's going to happen. At the end of the day, this movie is about a woman showing us she can do exactly what men can do - if not more - and she saves her kingdom through her persistence and intelligence, not just her physical strength. Is that not the message of the animated film? (She also brings the more ""feminine"" idea of love/family into what are considered prized virtues. Yay.)This rendition of Mulan naturally has a lot of power; but the crux is that she can only harness that by being true to herself as a woman, not by being deceptive and trying to pass as a man. So there's some weird chi-related stuff. You're not okay with that but you wanted a talking dragon? You can't have this woman accept herself and her strength unless Eddie Murphy helps her to do so?For people wondering about the witch: she represents what Mulan *could* have become based on the biases at the time. The witch is ""evil"" because she was cast out for being a strong woman and sided with the only people who would tolerate her. Mulan, luckily, gets to show her country her strength and be appreciated for it on the ""good"" side.Mulan's character isn't as fleshed-out as it could be; additionally, the story is weaker in parts and seems rushed in some sections (in particular when she is turned away by the general only to be accepted back minutes later and put at the head of the group to save the Emperor). However, it is a solid story of intelligence and perseverance and the action scenes are fantastic, which somewhat makes up for the lack of character development.Although it's not a musical, if you pay attention, some of the songs from the animated film do make their way into this edition. Also, some of the lines from the animated movie are repeated in this. (Mulan was my favourite ""Disney princess"" when I was a kid so I really noticed these nods to the older movie.)In short, this film has its flaws but I thoroughly enjoyed it as a new take on a classic. Stop being so butthurt it's not a carbon copy of something you already watched.",Mulan,2020-09-04,5.6,115044,2020

tt1070874,8,"Legal historians and courtroom drama fans will have a field day with this Aaron Sorkin film which depicts the trial of eight radical protesters who made a name for themselves in Chicago during the 1968 Democratic National Convention. A disparate array of left-wing activists who took it upon themselves to demand an end to the Vietnam War instead became involved in the ghastly legal aftermath of the riots and thus faced criminal charges for allegedly instigating the violence. This film portrays the sham trial that took place.Jospeh Gordon-Levitt, who has not been in anything good for a long time, is solid as the lead federal prosecutor who reluctantly takes on the assignment of trying to put the radical protesters behind bars. Mark Rylance's modest, down-to-earth demeanor makes him a rather peculiar fit to portray defense attorney William Kuntsler, the famous defense attorney well-known for his outspoken courtroom oratory and publicity hound antics. Frank Langella is flawless as Julius Hoffman, the judge who presided over this trial and whose combustible temper and tenuous mental faculties made him a ready target for ridicule from many, including those involved in the case. Edie Redmayne is excellent as Tom Hayden, the more pragmatic but equally passionate protester and defendant. Sacha Baron Cohen and Jeremy Strong are both stellar as defendants Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin, respectively. Finally, Yahya Abdul Mateen II is eloquent as Bobby Seale, a Black Panther Party co-founder and the lone African-American defendant in the case.There are discreet details about the trial I was hoping the film would cover. There is no mention of Bobby Seale's many colorful nicknames he assigned to the judge. It mentions the poet Alan Ginsberg only as a fellow protester, when in fact he was also called as one of several celebrity witnesses. So was the musician Judy Collins who began singing an anti-war song during her testimony. These, however, are minor oversights because the fundamental essence of this circus of a trial is effectively captured in the film. Unlike much of Sorkin's earlier work, the dialogue in this film is less grandiose and more straightforward. There are less pyrotechnics and more re-creation here. I mean that as a compliment. It's the perfect portrayal of a trial which turned out to be a low point in the history of American jurisprudence. It also expertly captures the schism within the American left and how the idealists and pragmatists often locked horns even back in the 1960s. Gripping, frightening and instructive in today's world, it is not to be missed. Highly recommended to all.",The Trial of the Chicago 7,2020-10-16,7.8,113693,2020

tt1070874,6,"This was a good watch of a movie about a really important and interesting chapter in US legal history. it's actually an 8.5, but loses substantial points for falling for the Hollywood practice of changing historical events for slight or unfathomable reasons.
Very well acted and presented, the impact was substantially lessened on finding out the details that had been changed to make this a ""better film"", as if that is the main priority when dealing with a historically well documented story.
In the list of changes made none of them rang as important, necessary or advantageous in anything but a marginal way, and in some cases did a massive disservice to the real life characters. Notably ""David Dellinger, a committed pacifist, never hit a court officer or anyone during the trial. In fact, the real Dellinger remained peaceful in the courtroom even when a marshal struck one of Dellinger's children"". That's a huge point in miss-representing Dellinger for a marginal and unimportant piece of drama.
""It was Dellinger, not Tom Hayden, who attempted to read aloud in court a list of people who had died in Vietnam, but he was immediately held in contempt and not allowed to finish."" and the list was importantly a list of both US and Vietnamese fallen, not just American troops.
Again a massive misleading of the audience for a feel good ending that didn't happen. And the actual closing statement was very powerful already, but left out. How are we served by this manipulation? It's not a better story so much as just a different one and in the case of historical stories the interests of the viewer are better served but sticking to what happened. The reality of what really happened is easily interesting enough to hold us for the duration.""Seale was gagged and chained as shown. But the film implies that this only happened once for a short time and that the egregious nature of this treatment immediately shamed the prosecution into moving for a mistrial and a separate trial for Seale, when in fact Seale was first bound and gagged on October 29, 1969, and he had to appear in court that way for 3 days until his trial was severed on November 5, 1969"". This is real drama left on the table.""The character of Daphne O'Connor (Caitlin FitzGerald), an undercover agent assigned to surveil Jerry Rubin, was a complete fabrication for dramatic effect.""Why? For comedy effect?""Tom Hayden says the reason that he was not drafted was that he had a high lottery number. That is impossible as the lottery started after the trial began""The fabrication and liberty taken with the real events diminishes the power of this movie and realistically educates a large amount of people in incorrect details, selling everyone short and treating the subject matter with disrespect, for what end gain?",The Trial of the Chicago 7,2020-10-16,7.8,113693,2020

tt1070874,8,""" I have never been on trial for my thoughts"", this one line sums it up about the whole movie. Watch the movie, not only for 5 reasons given by Yayha Abdul Mateen, but the writing, the thoughts, and deliverance. When I decided to watch this movie, it was only for the reason of Aaron Sorkin and star cast and with very limited knowledge of the events which took place in 1968 in chicago. However, with in first 30 minutes of 2 hours, it took me back to days when a one minute long monologue of Jack Nicholson in ""A Few Good Men"" gave goosebumps to an adult of 18 years of age who was not very fluent in english and not very familiar with american judicial system or revelation in "" Charlie Wilson's War"" , which was an another vantage point of looking at geo-politics happening in my country and region.The Trial of Chicago 7 may not have a room to depict drama as seen in previous work of Aaron Sorkins, however in 2 hours and 9 minutes, Aaron and cast of the movie has depicted whatever they could. The script not only provided a dimension to the trial, but the struggles of the main 7 character and the bianess they encountered from the Judicial System.The Court Room thriller, which also based on real event has become alive with this movie and surely will take back you to the days of ""Primal Fear"", ""12 Angry Men"", "" Philadelphia"", "" A Few Good Men"" , in which words, thoughts, and real human expression influenced an individual's thinking process.The entire cast of the movie has performed their best and Aaron Sorkins in his second direction venture has given a classic. The movie which for first few minutes appeared to be political satire eventually turned out to be a great political case, as told by Sacha Baron Cohen.",The Trial of the Chicago 7,2020-10-16,7.8,113693,2020

It preaches to the liberal progressive choir, of which I'm a card-holding member, and it decides that such things as nuance, subtlety, or even slightly different points of view are unnecessary clap trap and offers us instead the admittedly cathartic experience of a two-hour shout of outrage at our messed up culture. But hoo boy, is this movie pretty ridiculous. Even while I was being entertained by it, I knew I was being shamelessly manipulated, which I could tolerate for a while, but the end of this film, which plays against one of those blaringly self-righteous movie scores, would make even Steven Spielberg cringe.This movie is as watchable as it is because of the actors, and though there are many fine performances in this ensemble cast, I have to single out Mark Rylance, as the defense attorney for the 7, who deserves an Oscar for trying to make a serious movie out of Sorkin's superficial pap.Grade: B- (This is one of those movies that feels like an ""A"" while you're watching it, but sinks lower and lower in your esteem the more you think back on it).",The Trial of the Chicago 7,2020-10-16,7.8,113693,2020

It is about a group of people that were protesting the Vietnam War and headed to Chicago to do that in front of the 1968 Democratic convention.

For a start I found out about this story when I watched a documentary on 1968 happenings on t.v last year. As far as the film goes I think the performances all around are terrific. Sacha Baron Cohen as Abbie Hoffman was one of the leaders of protesters and he was a real standout funny, heartbreaking and fierce. The film is very dialogue heavy and includes a lot of courtroom scenes but if you love that stuff you will love this movie. I feel the film is very timely as far as division with protestors and police and I just can't say really how great this film was than just to see it as soon as you can.

Tom Hayden played by Academy Award Winner Eddie Redmayne brings a droll but nuanced performance to this well scripted movie. Based on the real life story, the script brings the feeling of the era to this move. However, the final product feels less like a 60's film of the era and more like a polished dialogue heavy play. This is not to say the film doesn't have its brilliant components. Because it does. The directing is strong and the performances are captivating. This is a surefire bet for a Best Screenplay nomination at the Oscars. Overall, it feels very relevant today and it hits its a nerve throughout. Sorkin delivers again and Frank Langella shines as Julius Hoffman, the judge grow to hate from the first time we meet him. His performance brings a strong response from the audience to fully engage into this story. I can't wait to see this as a play.",The Trial of the Chicago 7,2020-10-16,7.8,113693,2020
tt1070874,7,"The Trial of The Chicago 7 oddly feels dated, like it could've released a decade ago. Coming from Aaron Sorkin, I think many expected more and better, which in some ways it's this movie's biggest downfall. Not to say that this is a badly made film at all, it's well made in every aspect, an impressive sophomore directorial debut by Sorkin, but it lacks just that touch to make it feel something more than just ""good."" All of the performances are good, but there's none I would consider to be truly great. One of the only performances that really stands out is Sacha Baron Cohen as Abbie Hoffman and even he feels like he's holding back. What truly deserves praise is the structure given to the story as it cuts from the court room to flashbacks making what's mostly a slow court trial quite engaging. However, what is left is a competently made Hollywood historical piece, with an important, but shallowly presented message. The movie barely takes any time to actually delve into these characters and show us what they're dealing with. 2 of the Chicago 7, Lee Weiner and John Froines, barely get any screen time since they're mostly pointless to the story, but it could've been interesting to see more of their perspective on essentially getting used by the court. The other performance that stands out is Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as Bobby Seale. I thought that section of the movie was one of the more compelling, and should've been focused on more instead of forgetting it after he leaves the trial. The antagonists are just portrayed as dumb bad guys when they could've been far more developed to give a deeper analysis of the system and government. The message is definitely important, but all this movie ends up saying is ""Government bad, system flawed."" Ultimately, I would still consider this to be a good movie, I mean there's nothing I could really point out and call bad, but it had the potential to be a powerful examination of the government, system, court, etc. This just ends up feeling like the yearly Hollywood crowd pleasing historical piece that paints a nice picture of the events from afar, but lacks the fine details once you take a step closer to examine it.(7/10)",The Trial of the Chicago 7,2020-10-16,7.8,113693,2020
tt1070874,9,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Aaron Sorkin has been around for quite some time. A Few Good Men, Moneyball, Steve Jobs, and arguably one of the best movies of the last decade, The Social Network, all have one thing in common: Sorkin as a screenwriter, but not as the director. Molly's Game was Sorkin's directorial debut, which makes The Trial of the Chicago 7 only his second time in the director's chair. I've either loved or liked every film from him, so obviously, my expectations were already high enough solely due to his presence. However, with the announcement of such a stellar cast, it's impossible not to expect one of the best movies of the year to come out of this project...Expectations fulfilled. This is, in fact, one of 2020's very best films, without the shadow of a doubt. Based on real events, the movie quickly jumps to the main point of action: the trial. Only twenty minutes in, the viewer is already inside the famous courtroom where the expected and the unexpected occur simultaneously. Sorkin's employs a narrative structure that keeps me captivated until the final credits start to roll. The actions that led to this court case are demonstrated throughout the same instead of being shown through a linear timeline, which would reduce the trial's value. It's the main reason why such a simple premise turns into a phenomenal adaptation of the historical event.I couldn't take my eyes off-screen for a single second or lose one of the many incredible dialogues. Every conversation, every argument, every objection, overrule, or ""motion denied"" is transmitted to the viewer in an exceptionally captivating manner. It's one of those movies where the ""action"" belongs to words instead of fists. I felt tremendously invested in the trial. It never loses a gram of interest, it's full-on exciting all the time. I desperately wanted to find out the result of the case (I didn't possess knowledge of the real story, but I'll address this further down). I really wanted to witness the events that put the defendants in their respective positions. I strongly desired to see the end of the situation.As soon as the film ends, I felt the urge to immediately research everything about the true story. I spent close to forty-five minutes reading many articles about the 1968 Democratic National Convention, the riots, the presidential nominees... everything. This is one of the most important criteria I have to define how successful a historical flick truly is: how much does it compel me to research everything about it. The Trial of the Chicago 7 convinces me to study the real events with significant impact. From what I've read, Sorkin changes a few details timeline-wise (something pretty common in this type of movie), but overall, it's a pretty accurate, realistic adaptation.Technically, every component is remarkable, as expected from a Netflix-Sorkin partnership. However, the score plays a special part since its volume in crescendo elevates several escalating situations, leaving me at the edge of my couch, biting my nails. It's a fantastic achievement from Daniel Pemberton, who also scored Birds of Prey and Enola Holmes this year. Additionally, this might not be a one-location film, but Sorkin keeps the camera so focused on the courtroom that it feels like the audience is stuck in there with the defendants.Besides Sorkin's screenplay, the cast obviously plays a massive role. Just like I mentioned above, this is a movie where the ""action"" is played out through words. Inside the courtroom, there are constant arguments, countless contempts of court, a voir dire (it doesn't hurt to google courtroom terminology before the film), and so much more that leads the judge to make questionable decisions based on shocking evidence. Every actor is absolutely outstanding, I was able to feel everything during that trial, but I do have four standouts.Sacha Baron Cohen (Abbie Hoffman) shares the laugh spotlight with Jeremy Strong (Jerry Rubin), but he ends up being the ultimate comic relief. His delivery and timing are pure gold. I can't deny that I was surprised by his performance since I've only seen him in Borat. He's extremely funny, but don't be mistaken by my words: Abbie proves to be one of the most essential defendants in the trial, offering a memorable testimony and demonstrating his real purpose. Eddie Redmayne brings his Oscar-winner face to the game by interpreting Tom Hayden. A vital character that lets the viewer know that while they might not all be completely guilty, they're not all exactly innocent as well. Hayden's final speech is one of Redmayne's best scenes of his career.Mark Rylance plays the role of the public, portraying the defendants' lawyer, William Kunstler. He shares the viewer's frustration with the judge's decisions but never gives up, trying to bring justice to the case. If I had to bet on an actor to get awards buzz by the end of the year, it would be Rylance due to his powerful display. My last standout is Frank Langella as the judge Julius Hoffman. I believe a lot of people will give credit to every actor for portraying characters they love, but most will forget the actor that interprets the character everyone hates. Langella deserves all of the praise in the world for making me despise completely such an unfair, racist, unqualified judge. His performance is simply extraordinary.These are my four standouts, but the entire cast is phenomenal. I'm a bit disappointed that I didn't get to see more from Yahya Abdul-Mateen II (Bobby Seale), but after researching Bobby's involvement in this story, I understand his lack of relevance to the main narrative. He plays more of a modern parallel to the 60s in the sense that the judge heavily discriminates against him during the trial, transmitting a message that humanity's behavior may have evolved regarding racism, but there's still a long way to go. A final shoutout to Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who is also excellent as Richard Schultz.I only have one issue. In terms of entertainment, the viewer entering the main stage after only twenty minutes is a bold yet efficient move. However, the introduction to the characters and the story itself goes by so fast that I could only understand who's who and their purpose during the trial. Sorkin assumes people know everything about who these characters are, what they did, and where the narrative is driving towards, skipping through dozens of details that (mostly) non-American audiences will struggle to understand in time. Sorkin could have given these characters more depth initially, offering the viewer time to get familiar with their names and organizations.All in all, The Trial of the Chicago 7 is undoubtedly one of the best movies of the year, probably the best at the date of this review. Aaron Sorkin's narrative structure and the brilliant cast are the two main reasons why this film succeeds so well. Sorkin's screenplay is organized in a way that keeps the viewer astonishingly captivated throughout the entire runtime by following a nonlinear structure. Maintaining the focus on a single location is an exceptional decision for a movie where words are the action of the story. Inside the courtroom is where every fascinating argument ensues, never losing steam until the very end. It's also a lot funnier than I expected. Regarding the cast, Sacha Baron Cohen, Mark Rylance, Eddie Redmayne, and Frank Langella are my standouts, but every actor delivers outstanding performances. Daniel Pemberton's score shines in an overall very well-produced film. The first twenty minutes fly by in favor of entertainment by quickly placing the viewer inside the courtroom, but it's so rushed that it makes it difficult for the audience to remember everyone's names and purposes. Assuming everyone knows the true story and the people involved is a risky move, especially for non-Americans. Nevertheless, this minor issue doesn't affect an otherwise flawless movie. Obviously, I strongly recommend it! Maybe reading a bit about the real events beforehand will help the eventual viewing, but don't read too much due to the usual spoilers.Rating: A",The Trial of the Chicago 7,2020-10-16,7.8,113693,2020

This is liberal stuff with a capital L.Hoffman and his fellow defendants face off against a Government prosecution and a brazenly unsympathetic judge, Sorkin's screenplay works its magic through the sheer spectacle of the courtroom proceedings. Through testimonies and circumstantial evidence, it becomes clear that the accusations of a conspiracy are baseless, most obvious in the case of Bobby Seale (fiercely portrayed by Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), who is charged along with the Chicago 7 without any reasonable evidence of collusion.The confrontations between Hoffman and Tom Hayden (a steady, confident Eddie Redmayne) resonate as they explore the tensions between achieving progress through traditional, ""respectable"" means, versus disrupting the status quo by overturning a failing system.This movie would have already been a must-see film for its captivating ensemble, Sorkin script and rousing story.

Many people are praising her performance here. I think she's fine, but I don't think the script is anything special here and it doesn't help the actors. The scenes I enjoyed the most are those with Borat doing his thing by himself, but a lot of it felt to me like attempting to recreate the mood of the original.",Borat Subsequent Moviefilm,2020-10-23,6.7,113180,2020

This is why it is heart-breaking for me to tell you the stone cold truth: this Subsequent moviefilm is one of his worst works, it's even worse than The Dictator that held that title up to this point.Now, if you are a fan of Borat, like me, and you have Amazon streaming, there is nothing in the world that will stop you from watching this (especially it being free) so I think it will get the views, there is not need for all these fanbois 10/10 reviews on this site. This is not a spoiler review, however if you have seen the trailer you have seen everything that this movie has to offer (in fact the trailer have some shots that are not even in the movie itself!) there is no 'uncovering of Americas underbelly' and the worse thing, it's not even funny. Crazy to notice there are 10 names listed as writers list for this thing on top of Cohen himself. Really? maybe just let the comedian do his job? maybe?For some reason, the combination of 'candid camera' action and bad scripted non-candid camera just doesn't work this time. It comes out as a cringe-worthy 90 minutes of overly-gross juvenile humor. Where are all the edgy scenes that we are used to seeing from Baron-Cohen? Just watch Who Is America for some good edgy Baron-Cohen humor. Even better, watch some of the serious work Cohen does in ""The Spy"" or ""The Chicago 7"" those are masterpieces who deserve the 8+ ratings they get. This one? neh-eh.Overall, this should be on the bottom of the things you should see from Baron-Cohen if you watched everything else already- sure sit down and watch a mediocre 90 minutes that can be covered in 2 minutes of a trailer.

tt13143964,10,"My husband loved SCB in all his incarnations (Ali G., Borat, Bruno, and that guy from Who is America). He'd quote parts of Bruno (""But first, more dancing with Bruno!"") as he'd dance around me in the kitchen. He'd quote parts of an interview SCB did with Dick Cheney, as I rolled my eyes. Every couple of years or so, he'd put on Bruno or Borat, and laugh, and laugh, while I just shook my head. In short, he reverted from a mature 35 year old man, into a a teen, because of this one comedian. I kind of hated it and really didn't see the appeal of Cohen's comedy which I found crude and sometimes downright offensive (i.e., ""In my country, they would go crazy for these two. That one, not so much.""). Until this Borat 2020 film, that is.Knowing he was such a fan, the evening of the day the film came out, I grilled him a porterhouse steak in bourbon and pecans, with a baked potato smothered in broccoli and cheese sauce, and relegated myself to sit through this new Borat without looking too bored or condescending.Two things happened.One, my husband, laughed several times, of course, but he did so less heartily than he had at most of SCB's prior work, and he never rewinded it to re-watch an especially funny part.Two, I loved it.This Borat film is hilarious!!! And not only is it both, in your face, and subtly hilarious, but it has sooo much heart, it nearly brought me to tears.

you did leave a mark, you left all your viewers speechless.
Be it in the reel world or the real world.
You were the most amazing character and I enjoyed you act, and sobbed at the same time, watching you smile and crack jokes made me so emotional.
How could a person this cheerful with the brightest not with us anymore.
This movie was very warm just the right mix of humor and drama and emotions.
Its so fresh that one can re-watch it a 100 times and still wont get bored.

tt7395114,9,"The Devil All the Time is a slow burn, thriller and melodrama with outstanding acting, exceptional editing, and precise cinematography. I love the focus on the theme of evil disguised as good. The film focuses on people who are thinking they are doing good under the guise of religion, God, and divine right instead of the harsh reality that they are terrible people committing terrible atrocities. Unfortunately, this is true to life. Obviously, this isn't saying all religious people are evil. It's more so that people are using religion as an excuse to commit crimes. The performances are all really good, and provide a look into the minds of sick, vile humans. The film is deeply disturbing because of how true to life it is and how it focuses on real life themes. It's extremely well crafted, and I love how it's presented, using voice over narration to dictate the flow of the film. The plot is a little convoluted, and the story could've been more thought out.

tt7395114,8,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Netflix has been able to deliver films with all-star casts pretty regularly. Whether people like the movie or not, that's a whole other subject, but as a convincing argument to make people want to watch a film, this type of casting is perfect. Almost every actor in The Devil All The Time is a fan-favorite due to their presence in cinematic universes, iconic sagas, or Oscar-winning flicks, so it's no surprise if this aspect alone gets audiences to sit in their couches for a movie with an almost two-hour-and-a-half runtime. This is my first time watching an Antonio Campos' film, and my expectations were moderately high, having in mind the synopsis and the genre itself.I didn't know what the movie was really about since the synopsis doesn't really shine a light on what the main narrative truly addresses. I only watch the first official trailer *after* I watch the film (so I know what I can write in my reviews), and to be honest, it's a bit misleading when it comes to the time certain actors are actually on-screen (Holland only shows up after forty-five minutes, for example). So, for the first hour-and-a-half, I found myself struggling to understand where the story was going. There are more than a handful of relevant characters and storylines, being this my main issue with the flick, but I'll get there.I'll start with the cast and their characters. The former group is impeccable, as expected. Tom Holland is undoubtedly the biggest surprise by delivering a part of him that no one had seen so far. Arvin's personality is shaped based on his traumatic, tragic, violent childhood. Transitioning from the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man to such a haunted character is not an easy task, but Holland finds a way of dealing with the emotionally overwhelming, dark path that Arvin walks. However, this is a long movie where every character has an important role to play, even those who barely impact the story until the last few minutes.Bill Skarsgård plays Holland's father, seamlessly incorporating a man whose blind faith in religion sets not only a horrible chain of events, but it also establishes the overall theme for the film. Riley Keough and Jason Clarke play a weird couple with a disturbing modus operandi, but the former is genuinely impressive. She's becoming quite an interesting actress by picking unique roles in unconventional movies. Everyone else is great, Robert Pattinson, Eliza Scanlen, Sebastian Stan, you name it, but Holland, Skarsgård, and Keough are my absolute standouts, as well as their characters. They're definitely most developed across the runtime than the others, which takes me to one of my negatives.With so many characters, the balance between the numerous storylines fails to be consistent enough to keep me engaged throughout the entire runtime. Antonio and Paulo Campos offer every character a good chunk of time, giving the viewer opportunity to understand the motivations behind said characters and connect with their story. Excellent storytelling method, no doubt about it. However, by the end of the film, some characters have close to zero impact on the narrative in retrospect. Contrasting with my standouts, a few characters feel one-dimensional, used merely either as a plot device to make the story go forward or as an object for gratuitous, gory, bloody killing.That last aspect might be a no-go for tons of viewers. There are dozens of sequences where a character is brutally shot or beat close to death, so you have my warning. It can go from entertaining to excessively gruesome in a matter of seconds. Nevertheless, the thing I love the most about The Devil All The Time will be the exact same many viewers will definitely hate: its take on religion. Similarly to Darren Aronofsky's mother!, this is a movie that doesn't shy away from depicting how blind faith in hardcore religiousness can be dark, somber, sinful, and take people through the most terrible of paths. It's the overall theme that connects every storyline.Throughout the film, almost every character's decision is made based on their religious beliefs in some shape or form. If they believe praying is the solution to cancer, they'll pray for days in a row and make sacrifices. If they believe God is giving them supernatural powers, they'll do everything to test his will. If they believe God is telling them to make the most illogical decisions, perform inhuman actions, and sin in the most awful way possible, they'll do it in the blink of an eye. This religious manipulation is depicted in such a realistic manner that it transforms The Devil All The Time into a pretty tricky viewing. For me, it felt so authentic that I can easily connect it to the state of the real world.From the moment I realized this underlying theme, the second half of the movie became much more interesting. Character arcs start to intertwine, previous questions being to receive their respective answers, and everything falls into place in the last thirty to forty-five minutes. However, the runtime still feels way too long and even though Antonio and Paulo Campos do a remarkable job by coherently joining the several storylines, some of these simply don't add anything to the narrative or to the protagonist's arc. Technically impressive across the board, standouts being Lol Crawley's lingering cinematography and the sweet score from Danny Bensi and Saunder Jurriaans.The Devil All The Time is destined to be incredibly divisive. Antonio Campos and Paulo Campos conjured up a somber, dark, extremely violent screenplay, packed with numerous storylines and an underlying theme that's going to cause some controversy. With such a stellar cast, it's impossible not to have outstanding performances. The entire cast is impeccable, but Tom Holland (the absolute standout), Riley Keough, and Bill Skarsgård deserve the shoutout due to their genuinely impressive displays. However, the high number of characters and their respective arcs unnecessarily overextend the runtime. Too much time is given to characters who, in retrospect, barely have an impact in the narrative or in the protagonist. Some are used as mere plot devices or kill targets for the sake of entertainment. Nevertheless, the narrative's focus on religion is bold and audacious, showing how blind faith can negatively influence people's lives, taking them and others through the most painful paths. Depending on each person's view on religion, on how open the mind can be and the sensibility to bloody violence, I leave my warning that this film might not be for everyone. But, if it is for you, it will be hard to forget.Rating: B+",The Devil All the Time,2020-09-16,7.1,97543,2020

tt7395114,9,"So there's this new film on Netflix where Spider-Man, Batman and the Winter Soldier make up only a few of the oddball characters in the bleak and unforgiving crime thriller, The Devil All the Time, from Antonio Campos. Now, I'm going to stop right there and tell you that is a ridiculous way to approach this film yet it seems some just aren't ready to relate the actors in this film to anything other than the superhero films they've either already graced or about to. The three respective actors are only a small part of an ensemble cast that may just be the most imipressive of the year.Arvin Russell (Tom Holland) is a young man devoted to protecting the ones he loves in a postwar backwoods town in Ohio but when a number of sinister characters converge around him, he faces a true test against corruption and brutality.Our lives can be shaped by a number of varying aspects at such a young age, whether it be through how we are raised by our parents or what we see in the outside world. Amidst the backdrop of a small backwoods town in postwar America, The Devil All the Time is set when both family and religion had a major imprint on people, Arvin Russell in particular being exposed to a childhood of violence carried out by his father on others.Antonio Campos' film is quite an experience, taking time to settle into its surroundings and many characters but it warrants being a bit of a slow burner with a neatly woven narrative that doesn't shy away from violence, catching me off guard a few times throughout. It's an important part of the narrative though as Arvin struggles with finding a path in life that doesn't lead down the same route his father's took.Campos has quite a cast at his disposal and he really does get the best out of the film's major players, Tom Holland giving one his finest performances to date in the lead role that showcases a real sense of vulnerability amidst the responsibility to protect those he loves. Robert Pattinson is the scene stealer of the film as a rather unholy preacher that once again proves how electrifying a performer he really is. It's a film made up of many characters that we don't particularly spend a lot of time with but it's testament to Campos as director that he can get such good performances from his cast no matter how minor their role.The Devil All the Time is a meandering crime thriler that will hold you in a vice-like grip for large parts of its runtime before releasing with quiet but unflinching moments of brutality. It's most definitely one of the best films of the year.",The Devil All the Time,2020-09-16,7.1,97543,2020
tt7395114,9,"OK so let me start out by saying this movie is not for everyone. People who are religious will not like this movie, if you have faith in mankind this movie will make you take a hit on that as well.The title says it all; The Devil All The Time. This Movie Follows a chain of events where people with faith are getting take advantage off by perverted individuals or people that have been driven crazy by religion. The story's main protagonist is Arvin, The only son from Willard (an ex-WW2 soldier) and Charlotte (an Waitress). When Arvin is 9 his mother is dying from an illnes, and Even though Arvin's father is obsessed with praying it doesn't save his mother. But Arvin's father (Willard) also teaches him to choose the right time to get back at somebody and take faith in your own hands. And that is what this movie is teaching us. There is no god protecting us and the people who believe so are being taken advantage off by the devil. This movie is well crafted well written and with outstanding performances from the entire crew a must watch and Netflix did it again.",The Devil All the Time,2020-09-16,7.1,97543,2020
tt7395114,9,"The acting in this movie is exemplary and should be used more often. The lack of a true main character for the story to revolve around quickly becomes to its advantage. It's a very slow burn movie (and by no means for all people) and revolving between characters every so often helps the story not become stale. Kind of like Magnolia. I'm about to go into spoilers so I suggest you stop reading if you're considering watching this movie. The movie beautifully shows how religious beliefs can corrupt the mind and make people delusional or be used for corrupt purposes like convincing young girls to have sex. The first 30 minutes or so of the movie is used to set up our characters and rightfully so. We are going to spend the next hour and a half with them after all let's give them backstory. Those 30 minutes are tastefully used to show us the backstory instead of having some throwaway line about how Arvin's Dad committed suicide and killed the dog. The Bible Belt accents of characters were done very well and not distracting. One of the only issues I have with this movie is that the narrator continually pops in. At one point it takes me out of the movie completely when he says Robert Pattinson's character only became a preacher because he enjoys the power over people. That took me out of the movie a bit. But the narrator was used appropriately when he says that she stopped asking him to come to her mother's grave. All in all kind of a love-hate relationship just wished they would have shown some of the things he says instead of just telling us them. I understand not wanting to tack on extra scenes to an already long movie but 30 seconds to show he enjoys the attention people give him when speaking shouldn't have been that big an issue. This movie also has one of the best lines in a film I've seen from this year (albeit the selection is limited) when sheriff Bodack is in the squad car talking to young Arvin and says ""some people were meant to be buried""."" Almost gave me chills. The ending of the movie was well set up as I mentioned before it's a very slow burn but the climax was well set up by it. It's one of the most tense scenes I've seen in a while. Overall I'm gonna give this one a 9/10 not quite an instant classic but it will not be forgotten soon.",The Devil All the Time,2020-09-16,7.1,97543,2020

tt7395114,NA,"Tom Holland, the ultimate star and protagonist of the movie, appears only after the first 45 minutes. This 140-minute movie should have been a mini-series (someone may still make one, for all I know). As well, the brilliant support Robert Pattison appears only after Holland does. But then, the 45 minutes of ""prelude"" is comprised of no less than 3 separate stories, each good enough to become a separate movie. They are, of course, inter-connected in one way or another.Story One. Vietnam veteran Willard (Bill Skarsgard) comes home with PTSD. While his pious mother wants him to marry Helen (Mia Wasikowska), he falls for Charlotte (Haley Bennett) at first sight. Their son Alvin (Tom Holland, and Michael Banks Repeta at age 9) losses both parents before puberty. After Willard's desperate prayers and sacrifice (killing Alvin's favourite family dog) fails to save Charlotte from cancer, he commits suicide.Helen is the link to Story Two, which sees her married to mentally disturbed preacher Roy (Harry Melling), with whom she has a daughter Lanore (Eliza Scanlen). In a crazy moment, he takes Helen into the woods, stabs her to death, then asks The Lord to resurrect her. Like Will he dies too but not by suicide. The way he meets his death links to the third story. Lanore, just like Roy, becomes an orphan, losing both parents at the same time.Story Three, a minor subplot in itself, is about a pair of criminals Carl (Jason Clarke) and Sandy (Riley Keough) whose business is in conning victims into compromising photos with Sandy, scantily attired or not at all. Roy is one of the victims. Another character in this arc is Lee (Sebastian Stan), Sandy's brother, a corrupt cop.Remember: at this point, you have only seen 45 minutes of this 140-minute movie. Already, there are three stories each can legitimately claim a movie of its own. Arguably, what I have disclosed hitherto should not be labelled ""spoilers"".The main story, as you surmise by now, is between Alvin and Lenora. There is a third, a preacher called Preston (Robert Pattison), who is charismatic like Roy but mentally sound, if devious.Let me back up a little, and keep this as spoiler free as possible. After the opening 45 minutes, there is another brief prelude, set in 1957, just after the two children have separately become orphans. Alvin is taken into the wings of his uncle where he meets Lenora, a ""step sister"" adopted by his uncle. While there is no blood relationship between the two, romance is not on the cards. However, Alvin loves Lenora fiercely, as a sister. In this brief prelude, we see how Alvin braves a bunch of bullies twice his size in protecting Lenora.Finally, we move to the main movie, in 1965, with a proliferation of period pop music throughout as background. Our two protagonists are now teenagers. The early part of the ""main movie"" runs parallel with development of the dark side in Alvin's character and Preston's cunning lustful scheme with Lenora as prey. I'll stop here before treading into spoiler territory. Suffices to say that usual elements of lust, pregnancy, violence, vengeance, confrontation, and body counts come in abundance, with poetic justice to boot.This movie is a gutsy revelation of festering corruption (in more ways than one) under the serene pastoral surface of the Heartlands. Both the subject matter and the graphic visuals may be too much for some. Those who can stomach it will be rewarded with the enjoyment of some fine acting.As mentioned, the cast is star-studded. With no gender discrimination, but reference only to this movie, the heavy-lifting is mainly by the men, and hence a heavy-weight male cast. Skarsgard, Melling, Holland and Pattison (in order of appearance) all shine while Clarke, in a comparatively less demanding roll, is still an impressive presence. One final observation, only of interest of Avengers fans: this is a reunion of Spiderman (Holland) and Winter Soldier (Stan).",The Devil All the Time,2020-09-16,7.1,97543,2020
tt7395114,8,"IN A NUTSHELL:
Netflix presents a new film directed by Antonio Campos based on the gothic crime novel also called The Devil All the Time. What's cool is that the movie is narrated by Donald Ray Pollock, the author of the book! Knockemstiff is a town featured in the movie that you'd swear was a made-up name, but it""s a real place where Pollack grew up. The movie is produced by Jake Gyllenhaal, which makes sense because the characters sort of feel like characters Jake has played in some of his former movies. Speaking of the cast, that's why you want to watch this movie. It's like attending an acting class. That being said, it's a bleak and gruesome movie that features the ugliness of twisted people. This is NOT a family-friendly film, nor one you want to watch with your grandma.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
Gory, bloody scene of a man on a cross
A disgusting scene with a bunch of spiders. EEK! Yes, they used real spiders.
A kid gets a black eye from a fight (we don't see the fight)
Suicide, deaths
Bloody murders
Two awkward car scenes that imply sexual encounters
Profanity, including several F-bombs
You see a woman in just her bra, then topless
You see a naked man full-frontalTHEMES:
Gossip
Faith/religion
Standing up for yourself and others
Deception
The lives we touchTHINGS I LIKED:
Robert Pattison has been cranking out a lot of exceptional performances lately. Recently, he starred in Tenet and last year The Lighthouse. He uses an interesting voice for his character in this film, something he loves to do. He has stated before that he feels like a fake if he sounds like his regular voice. In fact, he wouldn't let anyone hear the voice he was going to use until the first day of filming.
The Amazing Spider-Man fans will love seeing Tom Holland in this. You'll be impressed by how Peter Parker disappears and a new character emerges, as Tom Holland uses his physicality to completely change his persona. Be patient...he doesn't actually show up in the movie until 46 minutes in.
Marvel fans will also enjoy seeing Sebastian Stan, although you might not recognize him. The MCU represents well in this movie.
Strong production values
All of the female actresses were great and did a lot with the small roles they were given. Kudos to Haley Bennett, Mia Wasikowska, Eliza Scanlen, and Kristin Griffith.
The scenes were shot on 35 mm film, which is rare for a Netflix movie.
Jason Clarke was good, but we've seen him be this kind of character before.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
When people today see religion portrayed like this in movies, it's no wonder they want nothing to do with Christianity.
Like horror movies, the characters are clueless and don't see what should be obvious.
Most of the characters are all the same age so there's not a wide range.
With a title like The Devil All the Time, you can bet that there are some extremely dark moments you'll wish you didn't see.
Time is supposed to pass, but the characters don't really age.
The story jumps forward and backward in time, which could make it difficult for some viewers to follow.You can see the rest of my review on my Movie Review Mom channel!",The Devil All the Time,2020-09-16,7.1,97543,2020
tt7395114,7,"When watching movies I don't normally feel too compelled to write a review but for this movie I will. The Devil All the Time by Donald Ray Pollock is a haunting, twisted story with many complex characters which is what makes the book so interesting because you don't know what they'll do next. Sadly, in the movie, directed by Antonio Campos, the plot is jumbled and the characters' subtext is thrown out almost all together. While I suppose this is to make the movie more mysterious and slow burn, it doesn't work for me. On the other hand the acting was phenomenal! Tom Holland, Robert Pattinson, and Bill Skarsgård took the cake for me. They're performances were hands down the best part of this movie. I could barely take my eyes off the screen during their scenes. Overall, the movie's plot was poorly put together and script could use some work (I do like that they used some dialogue from the book) but the acting was phenomenal and the cast did a great job with what they had.",The Devil All the Time,2020-09-16,7.1,97543,2020
tt7395114,5,"First things first, The Devil All the Time undoubtedly has the cast of the year. Tom Holland proves himself as a legitimate actor worthy of awards recognition and Robert Pattison makes the most of his limited screentime to create a truly chilling antagonist. The supporting players also shine with Riley Keough, Sebastian Stan, and Eliza Scanlen also delivering great performances.However, outside of the performances there is very little to say about Devil All the Time that is positive. Antonio Campos's script bites off more than it can chew, with themes of religious fanaticism, generational trauma, and the nature of violence popping up on multiple occasions. But the film has so many topics it wants to explore that none of them end up being fleshed out in any satisfying way, leaving the audience with a bunch of half-baked ideas and a sense of emptiness,Perhaps this would have worked better as a miniseries with a slow burn or as a shorter film with less characters and subplots. But in its final form The Devil All the Time is a watchable but forgettable experience that won't leave anyone hungry for more.",The Devil All the Time,2020-09-16,7.1,97543,2020

It's sad to think, that perhaps the only other outfit to be given funding for such a project are the Cohen brothers.

It made me smile, tap my foot and just escape a little to a happy place during a terrible time in the world.Is it the most deftly acted, written and produced movie...no, no Oscar nominations, I'm pretty sure. But that's not the point.What it does offer to the audience is a bit of fun and escapism, and a bunch of good laughs and cringe-worthy moments. It also left me a little lighter in spirit, and It reminded me to take the world less seriously. This was just what I needed during a pandemic, rampant racism, a horrible government and climate change out of control. There's so much that is wrong, that a little right is helpful.

It uses many famous Icelandic actors and there are loads of small references to Icelandic things that only people how have been to Iceland would pick up on.A part from all that the movie is great.

The film wasnt as funny as I had thought it would be, but instead found myself in tears at the end of the film. This is because this movie PERFECTLY represents what Eurovison is about, a proud cultural phenomenon that strives in diversity and community. This is a MUST SEE movie.

tt8580274,10,"I'm an American who's been living in Europe for 15 years and had never heard of Eurovision before moving here. I now watch it each year and think it's hilariously kitschy, spectacular, and, every now and then, there's even a great song. This film brilliantly captures all of those elements of Eurovision in a film that's both extremely funny and moving. The song ""Husavik"" is genuinely great and there are some other fabulous musical moments as well, such as the ""songalong"". I suspect that most of the bad ratings come from Americans who've never seen Eurovision before and probably haven't ever been to the Nordic countries, so don't have a sense of what's funny about the characterizations of both. I don't say that with arrogance - I also didn't know before I moved here! In any case, I hope Americans will give this gem of a film a chance. It was clearly made with love and Will Ferrell took a risk making a film about a country he must have known most Americans have no interest in.

I'm not sure if you have to be a true Eurovision fan to really feel that this film does go deeper than what's on the surface. We didn't get a contest this year, this more than makes up for it, but we did get a special on the BBC (and across the world!) where the hosts were virtually speaking to this years entries and past contestants. This programmme really moved me and it was really heartwarming to see Europe come together through this crisis, and this film gave me the same feeling knowing Eurovision fans all around the world would most likely be checking this movie out as a replacement for a show this year. If there was a perfect time for this film, it's now!The only thing missing in the film was the postcards!! They could have done something so cool with these so I wish they'd been included but either way it's still a 10/10 from me!The low scores really baffle me, you have to take this film for what it is.

Concept: People take pill gives them temporary superpowers unknown before you take the pill. Gives the movie a different take on the mutant craze.Special Effects: Varies, but one special effect with the invisible man is off the charts and almost single-handily gave the movie an extra star.Cons:
Direction: All over the place, bad writing, bad characters, just bad. Jamie Foxx and Joseph Gordon Leavitt can be excellent actors, but here there is no material to work with.Editing: Long scenes of nothing, edited scenes of the action you want to see.

tt7550000,5,"2020. First we had >Extraction. Then we had >The Old Guard. Now, here it is. The ""next step"" in the string of mediocre Netflix blockbusters: >Project Power. Ordinary as they go just from the title. To put it plain and simple, this movie is basically the zenith of dejà vu. Everything it shows we have seen before (>Limitless being the most obvious source of ""inspiration"").So, the realm of originality is somewhere far beyond reach. Anyway, when you have taken into account the ordinary and derivative nature of it all, you can almost enjoy yourself. Almost.
Because, given its somewhat good premise, the movie could have been much much better and very much more entertaining.
But, being the end result as it is, it's just a matter of a pretty sad list:The plot. Well, the plot is just as much predictable as you could imagine and it's furthermore just a pretext;The script. It doesn't seem to know where to go at times, it ""gifts"" us with wanna-be funny one-liners and with a series of never-so-much one dimensional characters (especially the bad guys);The direction. It's simply a drab and can't quite manage to handle the action scenes, which are always messy or standard;The acting. It seems rather listless. There certainly are good actors like Foxx and Gordon Levitt here, but they don't seem all that interested (and given the material they had to work with you can understand why).There you go: the zenith of deja vu coupled with the apotheosis of the generic and sometimes stale.>Project Power seems at the very least intriguing at first (in the beginning, till the ""Human Torch"" scene), but the more it goes on the more you can't help yourself but wonder what it may have been if it had been written and directed by a better director and a better screenwriter. In that case maybe a 6 or 7 could've been reached.But - as the saying goes - you don't make history with the ""ifs"". As I already suggested, being the movie as it is, it's just mediocre. ""Watchable"" if you want, but mediocre nonetheless. And a tad little bit nonsensical if you ask me (and maybe it's really just me, but I'm thinking right now: why the hell would anybody want to take a pill that they don't even know if it's gonna work, how it's gonna work and that could pretty much disintegrate them right away?).",Project Power,2020-08-14,6,71796,2020

tt6048922,9,I served on a destroyer during the Korean War. This movie really captured the excitement of being on the bridge during convoy duty.,Greyhound,2020-07-10,7,71521,2020
tt6048922,9,"Having served in the Cold War on both a destroyer and on a submarine, I found this story contrasting the tensions between both worlds. The action is shown from the bridge, CIC, and decks of the Greyhound, which BTW is the slang term for destroyers and those who serve on them. Hanks subtly conveys the ache of leaving a loved one behind and her presence with him during the battle. He and his crew feel the presence of the subs stalking the surface ships and the deaths of sailors both above and below the icy water. There is no perfect rendering of combat in film, but the repeated commands and protocols between naval personnel and vessels are accurate enough to convey a sense of proper urgency to the story. Compressing roughly 48 tense hours into a ~2 hour film doesn't give much time to absorb all that's happening, and that's the point. Training and subsequent reactions shape the story in the faces of the bridge crew as they watch the captain and follow his orders which he does not explain. This is about relationships between combatants, among the ships in the convoy, and between U.S. and British allies. This film, The Enemy Below, and Das Boot make a reasonable trilogy for a weekend marathon. Enjoy this story from either a technical or a relational view as you see fit.",Greyhound,2020-07-10,7,71521,2020
tt6048922,7,"Spectacle? Dramatization? No. This movie allowed me to experience ww2 naval combat without the bombast of the usual action movie. It felt realistic with a decent amount of suspense, a glimpse through the eyes of the captain.",Greyhound,2020-07-10,7,71521,2020
tt6048922,9,"This is a movie about the procedure of command. This is an innately more complex task than the more common episodic approach that buries the procedural reality under a mask of plot and character. But this film pulls it off, largely by not shying away from the task.Guess what? Naval warfare, especially the sort of highly asymmetric warfare shown here, doesn't really revolve around the captain demanding more speed while the engineer says she canna take it. If you're looking for a movie that's truly respectful of the labours and sacrifices made in the Battle of the Atlantic, then this is a fitting tribute.Don't expect a character movie, don't expect to spend time below decks exploring the usual stereotypes. This movie is seen through the eyes of the captain, and the captain alone. I can think of very few other films that dare to depict the loneliness of command quite so clearly. There's little time for thought, there's no time to process or even truly grasp the horrors that they encounter (something which forms one of the roots of PTSD). What there is is the fight.The fight is relentless and deeply technical. We've become used to fight scenes carrying a few bits of technical gibberish followed by some visceral and personalised action. There's no gibberish in this film, and the latter consists of the captain cutting his feet on broken glass. The movie, like the mind of the captain, is consumed with the intricate technical and personal demands required to hunt down a submarine at that time. That was clearly the aim here, and the movie has succeeded admirably at showing that particular aspect of this type of warfare. This is not a common way to stage a war movie, but it's worth doing well on a few occasions, and this movie achieves its goal.The reviews show that many come looking for something more conventional, and end up missing the point, which is a shame.",Greyhound,2020-07-10,7,71521,2020
tt6048922,8,"Funny... reading the other reviews is what encouraged me to write mine. Most of the low scoring reviews complain about poor character development or thin plot lines. We've had 80 years of movies giving us lots of historical detail, real or imaginary characters development and simple or convoluted plot lines from the World War II era. This movie didn't really need a lot of that to tell the story it was trying to tell. If you're paying attention, you can see the characters develop as the story is told. You can see the scared people gather their courage, the dedicated and loyal people that ""take one for the team,"" and the dedicated captain who will change out of his service shoes bloodied from days of constant wear into the slippers that his girl friend gave him as a gift.There are plenty of movies that have tried to give you complex stories with multiple plot lines and lots of character development only to fail and perhaps try to make it up in the form of some action scenes. This movie was never about that. The action is first and foremost what drives it, and you learn about the characters through the course of the events of the action. This movie was great for Apple TV+ but, it probably would not have been as great for a theatrical release.",Greyhound,2020-07-10,7,71521,2020
tt6048922,8,"Honestly, I decided to write a review to counter some of the more trivial reviews found in this thread and to try and present an objective perspective of this film.Firstly, the dialogue in this movie is typical for a movie depicting World War II Naval life and is accurate to the time period. Do not watch this film if you expect anything other than period correct Naval terminology or the constant passing of orders between the captain and the crew, as you are not going to be satisfied with this movie. Ninety percent of the dialogue in this movie relates to the business of conducting asymmetrical naval combat in a high-speed situation and is way too short to have a grand introspective or extrospective expose on the psychology of warfare or one's place in the world. Sadly, the short length of this film prevents any adequate amount of time dedicated to forging interesting and dynamic characters or a complex plot with a villain that was somewhat pointless. If anything, the director should have lengthened the film to expound upon the narrative and bring our cautious, somewhat hesitant, captain to life or pick a handful of critical Sailors to develop a relationship with within 80-minute time constraint.Secondly, there are better movies or shows that depict the Battle of the Atlantic which brings me to my second point. If anything; this film should have been broken into a mini-series, like Das Boot or a full feature series like Band of Brothers or The Pacific. Had the directors decided to embark upon that route, we could have had a significantly stronger plot and been able to identify with the characters in a more empathetic way. As a former United States Navy Sailor, I felt right at home with the style, accuracy, and briskness with which the film endeavored to portray. However, I did not find myself overly attached to any of the featured characters. In fact, the film attempts to ""show"" us that we should feel shocked, saddened, or disheartened by the plight of these Sailors, however, without any in-depth character development, I found it difficult for me to feel any more than somewhat saddened, and by the time that I did experience this emotion, the movie moved onto another chaotic event. Reflecting upon the movie now, maybe that is the point of the plot? Maybe, the film tries to showcase that the chaos of battle does not grant us a moment of emotional expression aside from the adrenaline rush of combat or a life-threatening event. In any case, if you are looking for significant character development, and a grander view of the Battle of the Atlantic at large, this is certainly not the film for you.Lastly, I do not, in any capacity, feel like I wasted an hour and half of my life like some of the other viewers felt. For me, it was a nostalgic trip back into an old life that I long forgotten and I enjoyed every minute of this film despite its shortcomings. Has Tom Hanks done better? Certainly. Did I think he did a poor job with this film? Absolutely not. While my main complaint is that this film could have been significantly longer, I am left with a desire to want to explore more in regards to the treacherous Battle of the Atlantic and the men of all nations who participated.Overall - I was pleasantly surprised with this movie, and while I felt that this film could have been produced as its own mini-series in order to develop the plot and the characters better, I thoroughly enjoyed my time, and I am sure I will return to it again in the future.Enjoy!",Greyhound,2020-07-10,7,71521,2020
tt6048922,8,"Loved the authenticity and general faithfulness to the technical side of naval warfare. For me, this is a great movie, I love seeing small little details in how the captain commands his vessel, and every crewman doing their job, and quick glances to the CiC trying to keep track of enemy vessels. The movie didn't need to show the crewman following the captain around and repeating every word that Sonar/Radar reports, but it does so and adds a very nice detail that I found to be great, and also helped build the stress and tension everyone was under.My only complaint is that the movie could have been longer. I could definately have watched a 3 hour version of this that took it slower in the style of Das Boot. Other than that, I recommend this movie for anyone that loves the more technical parts of warfare and especially naval vessels.",Greyhound,2020-07-10,7,71521,2020
tt6048922,9,"Finally a movie that isn't conventional. We don't have to have character dev. This is a movie about war. If you need a backstory, learn some freaking history because it's pathetic how dumb Americans have gotten when it comes to history. The war in the Atlantic was very long and would be hard to make a movie out of it. How this movie is done, shows how the captains and crew would hunt and destroy Nazi u boats in that era. I'm glad the movie wasn't over 2 hrs like everything else in today's time. If you want to learn what it was like crossing the Atlantic during WW2, this movie is for you.

tt6048922,5,"Good production, quite intense, very interesting reenactment of a battle at sea, although I am not sure how realistic and accurate it is (those submarines liked to fight a lot in plain sight over the water, right?).My main issue? It was like a documentary, lots of battle time but no much human drama. No time given to develop any characters or even make us feel something about these people.
Ships were sinking in the middle of the Atlantic and we never had a look in the horror of trying to survive this. Even Hank's character felt flat. The few scenes with his love interest were rather awkward and didn't contribute much. At one point we were wondering if the captain was in the spectrum or something..Still, if you are a fan of WWII movies I suggest to watch it for the unique perspective of a battle at sea.",Greyhound,2020-07-10,7,71521,2020
tt6048922,6,"It was just OK which is reflected in my 6 star rating, which I think is generous. They made little effort at any sort of character development. Hanks has some sort of love interest that is hinted at, but that's it. I thought they were going to build some sort of bond between the captain and his Black cook, but that never got off the ground. We know almost nothing more about the man at the end than in the beginning.It's a difficult challenge to portray on film the battle between a destroyer and a submarine. This movie never really pulls that off, it's like listening to one side of a telephone conversation. The German U-boats never seem to be part of the narrative. They try to bring the U-boats in with their radio broadcasts which come across more as obscene phone calls than viable dialogue.Almost exactly half of the dialogue is sailors repeating orders. It got very tedious, very quickly. I thought they went too far in the whole ""navy talk"" department.I found the U-boat attack theme music to be mostly bothersome and heavy-handed, like death wail of a fat man, or a runner-up in Dumb and Dumber's most annoying sound in the world.The sea burial onboard was a moving tribute to our military dead. I couldn't imagine a better resting place than the open sea. I was air force and not really sure what we did. Threw bodies out the back of a C130?

Why make a movie about such a thin plot? Now, its rather difficult to make these comments about such dramatic events; but we are supposed here to review and rate a movie, not the bravery of those who fought and died in the events told by the movie.
So my question stands; on top of its thin plot, the movie has virtually no dialogues except a series of orders
""Right standard rudder!"" ""Right standard rudder, aye aye!""
""Steady ahead on 091!"" ""Steady ahead on 091, aye aye!""
""Contact bearing port 015, range 900 yards!""

At the end of each transmission you hear a loud wolf houl (because yeah, they are the wolf pack) that apparently comes from the evil Nazi commander. Really? Thumbs down from me.

tt6048922,4,"The movie chose action sequences over character development and I can support that. The visuals are amazing.
But it seems that the Germans had to be both mean and stupid in this film.
They had to be depicted as evil so they have them taunt the convoy and it's escorts by radio. No sub captain would give his position away like that.On top of that the Germans had top be depicted as stupid too and completely surfaced their Uboots all the time within visual range of the escorts BY DAY when they had perfectly good periscopes. Even in the middle of the convoy, right next to a destroyer at a range of a couple hundred yards. Lunacy, this never happened. Of course when they actually used periscopes they rose up like 10 feet into the air at a range of a maybe a mile from a destroyer.No no no.
When a sub spots a destroyer, he goes silent and goes away, he does NOT attack and surely not head on. Subs did not want to sink destroyers, they saved their precious torpedoes for merchant ships only. When a sub is forced to surface between two destroyers they also don't shoot it out, that's plain suicide.Cowboy action, bubblegum for the brain, nothing more.",Greyhound,2020-07-10,7,71521,2020

tt10539608,1,"*spoilers ahead* (but seriously, how does one spoil something so awful?)You know, some movies are good, others great. Some are bad, others terrible. Then there are the ones that simply in a league of their own. This will probably be one about which songs will be sung around the fireplace in the years to come. Why? Some intro is necessary.Ok - here's the gist. In the near future, a possibly habitable moon of Jupiter is discovered. A crew is dispatched to investigate. While they're gone, for some reason they're completely incommunicado, and back on Earth, climate change suddenly ravages and blows up the Earth. The planet is evacuated, and everyone is put on helicopters to go somewhere, curl up and die. No Bill Pullman here inspiring humanity to do an end-run around destiny, to fight on. Nope. Just give up. The movie does not relish in details like where exactly they go, how, or what they'll do to survive, or for how long. Nor how so many helicopters could be built, even in the future, or whether they are spacecraft or whatever vehicles are required to completely empty the earth. In two years. It does not get into whether Eric Trump is President and whether climate denialism is still a thing and why half the people are not protesting the other half no matter what, as is wont in a post-truth society. All we know is something really bad happens to the air and the Earth somehow is totally evacuated in two years.Clooney is cast as a terminally ill astronomer (again, why? What is the relevance? Everyone is doomed as it is) who discovers the said habitable planet, but inexplicably stays behind to man an arctic observatory. No explanation offered, none required. Somehow this one aging, sick man can run an entire site in the middle of the Arctic, singlehanded. I guess now we know why there is so much unemployment. Robots - first they dance, then they take our jobs. Anyways, upon the ship's return, the exploratory mission cannot find anyone to answer their phone calls. In an act of desperation, they even attempt to contact India and Australia. I guess that is when you know it is an emergency when the India call center won't take your calls. BTW Calling India - this is a decision reached with no small amount of deliberation by the crew, mind you. Why? Who knows.Clooney, by the way, is bored stiff and while playing gin rummy wiling away the final hours, by accident suddenly realizes this ship is due back. Typical oh crap! Moment. And tries to raise the crew. Guess everyone forgot about the first manned mission to Jupiter? Clooney however finds out his high-tech setup isn't high tech enough to even send a text message to the intrepid explorers as they hurtle back from the unknown. Never mind that we have been communicating with remote spaceships like Voyager since the 70s, with much less powerful equipment.Anyway, Clooney discovers he is not alone in his Arctic refuge. A lost child lurks within the site. And has been sleeping in some shelves somewhere, but apparently is not any worse for wear as she somehow also has found plenty of food, despite not knowing where the kitchen is. Again, let's not get into the plot-holes.Clooney locates ANOTHER billion-dollar mega-tech site, a short hop away by snowmobile. Why you would put two large expensive antenna sites side-by-side, in the Arctic, who knows. But, with aid of this child, or despite her, he climbs aboard a snowmobile to trek to this other high tech station to have a chat with the returning ship to let them know to not come back because of how royally we screwed things up in the two years they were gone (yes folks, climate change only takes that long to wreak havoc).Along the way, he faces some inexplicable but ridiculous adventures, nearly drowns, shoots someone, and is stalked by wolves. The point? Probably some symbolism and metaphors missed by simpletons like this reviewer. Finally, after reaching the station, he can talk to the ship. At first, they are in disbelief. But really guys? Two years? And there has been no communication? Were they on the Santa Maria? And it couldn't have been that much of a surprise - hell, scientists are hoarse from bleating these warnings.. today!Anyway, to the movie. Being stoic professionals, they thoughtfully analyze the situation, given the heavy implications of any action and the fact that the future of humanity is hanging in the balance. As expected, logic is promptly chucked out the nearest space hatch and sentimentality wins out. Despite the certain death that awaits them, two of the crew summon their samurai courage and choose to return to Earth anyway to face the music, and thus provide a more intimate setting for the remaining male captain and female subordinate (dim the lights & cue Marvin Gaye - ""Let's get it on"").These last two plan to return to the Jovian moon from whence they came, to populate it in their new roles as Adam and Eve to restart humanity. Interestingly, the woman subordinate is ALREADY pregnant - workplace harassment? It's also interesting that it is acceptable for future professional astronauts to get pregnant on missions... on a ship designed for scientific discovery...in outer space ...is a gynecologist on board? A pediatrician? Surgeon? Not sure if the ship has a maternity ward or facilities for daycare or childbirth (actually we are - nope!) ... what if mommy and daddy want to go on parental leave after they are done dodging asteroids for the week? Let's leave all those questions floating in space, please. I guess abstinence, birth control, professional mission discipline doesn't exist in the future, at least one envisioned by Clooney, who also directs what passes for a film.And that is pretty much it. Two survivors of humanity. With limited provisions. Going back to an alien moon to, presumably, screw away until the end of days, content they are doing it for the greater good. Not a bad way to go if you ask me. No thought though to the size of the gene pool? How are two people by themselves supposed to restart the human race? Heavy use of CRISPR? The departing suicidal crew members do not even have the courtesy to leave behind their reproductive DNA (at least not on camera). What about Earth's accumulated knowledge base: technological know-how, the arts, the humanities & other ark-like collectibles that may be required to start a colony that is man's last gasp for survival. You know, if you're back near Earth, you might wanna pick some of these things up? Even electronically? Before the planet disappears for good? Not even some Viagra guys? How about milk and groceries? Maybe even some livestock? Not even medicines?There are more plot holes in this movie than craters on the moon. The biggest one: why this movie was ever greenlit. But in the end, the movie is not meant to be a disaster epic. It just exists to guilt you into realizing we're really messing up the planet. You are left to connect the dots from there to the burning of the Amazon (the forest, not the company). I'm guessing a run on Fox was never planned.Probably the best thing about this movie was the cute kid, probably because she says and does nothing. Because she turns out to be a hallucination (a Sixth Sense style ghost?), a reminder that Clooney was a really bad father but one who created an awesome daughter who now pilots the aforementioned spaceship, which he had forgot about but serendipitously remembered in the knick of time to redeem himself, thanks to a game of solitaire. A hallucination she is, just like we end up hoping the movie turns out to be, because it is impossible to fathom how such a god-awful movie could be real.With the high-profile releases of Tenet and now this abomination, maybe it is about time we recognize the editors, producers, writers & directors who take advantage of us forcibly transmogrified into couch potatoes during the Covid crisis, who think we will gullibly swallow anything their not so creative minds can barf up. They feel we shall simply marvel at how clever, witty & deep the plot & acting are, simply because they are incomprehensible & utterly impenetrable, & how thought-provoking their ideas & themes relating to humanity are dealt with through metaphors that in actuality are just pot-inspired time-fillers.In short, they have gift wrapped their ill-thought-out and foul-smelling turds with fancy bows, made a fuss of the presentation & placed them under our plastic Christmas trees. Perhaps realizing that in the present zeitgeist, people can't even agree on basic tenets of reality (pun intended), they figured why then should we bother with critiquing mediocre fiction? It certainly seems to be a plausible thought process behind Midnight Sky and Tenet (to which Sky plays the dumber, poorer brother) - but both are equally absurd and nonsensical in their own right, yet filled to the brim with melancholic, illogical, non-sensical self-importance.But to the Hollywood elites who want to foist their garbage onto us, the hoi polloi, let me say, dammit, some of us do give a damn! Really, we do! We will not settle for turds disguised in Rolex boxes, no matter how pretty, or how expensive they look. We will not give in. We will put up a fight. We will not go gently into the night! We will not let utter trash assail our senses and sight! We demand movies with some substance. We demand quality. We demand a plot for chrissakes! A new Zen-processor or cutting edge Nvidia graphics at the editors' desk does NOT mean you can leave the story completely by the wayside.Net of it is that Midnight Sky is nothing but a Clooney sized dump... not the soft plop plop of gently laid turds followed by a long flush... this is instead the full-on firehose fury of an exceptionally muscular rectum pressurized by prescription-strength laxative suppositories, unleashed in an unholy mess. Goes to show that no amount of special effects or star-power can save an epically bad story.",The Midnight Sky,2020-12-23,5.6,68944,2020
tt10539608,6,"So, this movie isn't perfect. Some things I liked and others bothered me. Like how the movie abruptly begins with absolutely no preamble. Normally I don't require hand-holding when movies start like this, but I seriously had to check 5 minutes in to make sure Netflix didn't start me halfway through the movie. Very annoying. Also, the fact that humans can detect planets in solar systems thousands of light years away, but we've never noticed a habitable moon around Jupiter?? Kinda dumb. I know, it's just a movie.. Also, why does the ship have rolling office chairs and IKEA shelving? Your hurtling through space a god knows how many kilometers a seconds and you can't secure things properly? The second the anti-gravity ring stops someone's getting that space helmet blown through the back of their head. And why TF did those dudes leave the ship? You family's gone, bud! By leaving your crew mates behind your decreasing their chances of survival. Just selfish. GC was good to watch, as always, and the cinematography was a treat for the eyes. This is a good movie for when your too tired to sleep and want something to enjoy a half-asleep half-awake state on the couch.

tt10539608,3,"""The Midnight Sky,"" a catastrophic science-fiction tale directed by George Clooney and based on Lily Brooks-Dalton's novel ""Good morning, Midnight,"" is about an emotional and physical journey. After a mysterious cataclysm has wiped out most of life on Earth, Augustine (George Clooney), a seriously ill astronomer who has spent his life looking for a hospitable exoplanet, refuses to escape with a group of survivors and is left alone in an Arctic scientific-research station. He knows a group of astronauts is traveling back to Earth and since he needs a powerful antenna to communicate with them, he sets off on a perilous journey to reach a far-off base.George Clooney's performance is brilliant, and some scenes are extremely engaging and nerve-wracking. Unfortunately the movie focuses mostly on Augustine's emotional awakening and neglects important aspects of the story. Too many scenes are devoted to his journey and inner struggle and this choice affects the narrative economy of the film. Its pace is slow and its development dispiriting.I would recommend ""The Midnight Sky"" to viewers fond of sentimental stories and not to those eager for action, adventure and the excitement of scientific exploration.",The Midnight Sky,2020-12-23,5.6,68944,2020
tt10539608,3,"The movie is marketed as Sci-Fi but is featuring uncoutable scientific inconsistencies. If you want some nice shot, it might be watchable. If you expect a plot which makes sense, avoid at all costs.
Heavy (!) spoilers ahead.Just a list of inconsistencies:
* Sometime around 2030(?) humans discovers an previously undiscovered (!) moon of Jupiter of a size able to hold its own atmosphere. Apparently no astronomer was involved in writing the plot.
* There is an (completely unexplained) apocalypse going on on earth, which must kill people off so unexpected, that noone was able to set up a messsge to transmit until acknowledged via the Deep Space Network. This leads to the next point
* Communication with space craft in 2049 is apparently via analog radio (one can hear interferences). Digital, especially text communication, which can be automated, must have been lost till then.
* The space craft has extremely spacious interiors, even more than Startrek. Apparently in 2049 all problems with accelerating unecessary mass from Earth to Jupiter and back have been solved.
* When about 10 days away from earth and supposedly on a trajectory to end up in an earth orbit, the space craft is still oriented with nose towards earth, engine away from earth. It appears to stay like that (as all meteors (see below) come from the ""front"". Apparently in 2049 one no longer needs the main engine for braking.
* Due to some (again unexplained) accident the space craft has to leave its current course and go into ""unmapped"" territory. Note that that is about 5 days before they reach earth. There is nothing unmapped such near to earth.
* In this ""unmapped"" area there is not only one but two space opera quality meteor fields hanging around. The first one of it hits the space craft with complete surprise despite the craft featuring a radar (which the crew then sets out to repair).
* Despite the crew being on a two year mission to and back from Jupiter one crew member has never trained space walking in all that time. Due they no longer do training exercises on missions?
* This crew member vomits when in zero gravity while putting on the space suit. This is despite the fact that every crew member has to cross the zero gravity section of their rotating star craft (BTW missing Coriolis forces) several times a day.
* Despite the vomitting, which would be highly dangerous if happening with closed helmet, the crew member goes on the space walk.Those are the ones I remember.

seizing the moment, some people are right now giving away their whole lives to fight for something that other people don't even value - physicists, biologists, ecologists, etc. - people who are gaining the knowledge on how we can survive and thrive not only as individuals, but as humanity as a whole.

I have absolutely nothing negative to say about the actors. All of them sold it very well. Sometimes managing to create a distinctive personage in just a few scenes.The only downside is the action.

Someone forgot to hire an editor to at least chop this down to 80-90 min max runtime. This film was based on a novel - was it as slow and boring as this film? It could've been much better with some ""Hollywood"" added into the writing whilst cutting down/out some of the long dragged out and useless scenes. And the screenplay needed to be tighter and lean more towards one genre; if you separated the ""arctic adventure"" from the ""sci-fi"", you may have had two much better short films. Combined, it was a lot of filler, with very little substance. Don't get me started on the very predictable and cliched writing-in of the absolutely adorable Caoilinn Springall as Iris in her first ever role. The awesome score also needed to be toned down, as it was too constant and overbearing - something you'd expect in a B-grade film. The S/VFX, set visuals and cinematography were absolutely stunning. The casting was excellent, but their talents were wasted in this poor story-telling that really didn't require much acting talent.

tt11464826,8,"First let me say I liked the messages conveyed in this documentary (not so much the dramatisations} and believe they are important and true, but ...
Is that because it was a one sided documentary (which it was) which always makes for a much more persuasive argument? Also, did I only watch this because it appeared on my Netflix Home page, and is this just because Netflix knows that I like these types of documentaries? If so, then I feel like I may have been manipulated by the technology and that this could actually be fake news, however if that is true then the arguments contained in the documentary are true which makes it real news.

tt11464826,3,"What do you call a ""documentary"" that takes a firm stance on one side of an issue, does not bother to interview a single person with a contrary opinion and then ends by asking you to do something?I have no love for social media companies. I don't even have a Twitter account. And there are legitimate social issues that need to be discussed, such as increased suicide rates amongst teenagers etc.But while this movie is claiming that social media companies are manipulating you into behaving differently than you otherwise would, the film itself sets out to scare the living daylights out of you immediately before ending with a request that you do something you otherwise would not have done. Rather hypocritical if you ask me.Don't trust film makers or Netflix any more than you trust Facebook or Instagram.Full disclosure: I work in tech (but not for any social media company), I hear these same claims on a daily basis and what the film does not tell you is that there are a lot of activist groups with different agendas trying to lobby the government into passing various laws at the moment. Not all of these groups are on the same page, or want the same things and they are not necessarily looking for the same results that you are. None the less, various individuals from these groups were featured in the documentary and edited such that it looks like they have a common goal and a common interest when they don't. For example: maybe you are concerned with the mental health of children as related to social media consumption, and an activist group - knowing that's something people care about - will give lip service to that issue while what they're really wanting to do is pass censorship laws because they want the power to control what can and can't be posted on social media.Just beware that this ""documentary"" was manipulative in itself, very one sided and does not accurately represent the disparate, nuanced and occasionally contradictory views of the various people represented.",The Social Dilemma,2020-09-09,7.6,67120,2020

Here the documentary fails to impress persons like me because all those things they ere saying aren't new to me or at least to a person who know what is the worldwide web.
The exaggerated cinematic visuals made it more like a staged performance rather than real facts and the funniest part is that they made fun of every other social media except themselves.

tt11464826,4,"The Social Dilemma is an unlikely hit on Netflix. Most of the 94-minute documentary is simple interviews with worried former tech-industry executives. The interviews are interspersed with a dramatized story about Ben, a teenager whose life is controlled by personified AI algorithms. Rather than building up to a climax, the documentary examines several problems with social media one by one. The heavy focus on interview snippets and the laundry-list approach is a recipe for a boring movie, but The Social Dilemma has garnered nearly universal acclaim.Early in the The Social Dilemma, several of the former tech execs are asked by the interviewer to describe the problem with social media. The execs are momentarily tongue-tied. The impression the documentary wants to give is that there is so much wrong with social media that the experts don't know where to start. But maybe the answer is just hard to summarize. In the last decade, social media has been associated with scandal after scandal - Russian vote tampering, the livestreaming of the mosque shooting in New Zealand, the promotion of extremist conspiracy theories, etc. The documentary assumes that its viewers already agree that social media has a problem. Like the execs being interviewed, we just can't say exactly why.One recurring point in the documentary is that social media companies don't have the best interests of their users at heart. A text frame announces that 'if you don't pay for a product, you are the product.' In particular the user's attention is what can be sold to advertisers. (Another text frame quotes data visualization pioneer Edward Tufte: Only two industries refer to their customers as users, illegal drugs and software'.) Social media companies do whatever they can to attract and hold the attention of users. The companies employ powerful artificial intelligence to predict what will bring a user to the app, and keep them there.If we stop there, the way social media keeps us connected sounds dystopian. But companies never have the best interests of the customer at heart. 'It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own self-interest,' wrote Adam Smith. Even if social media companies are out to harvest our attention, that isn't necessarily a bad thing. The outcome is what matters, not the motive. If social media companies keep our attention, it may be by giving us content that we find entertaining or informative. Maybe we go back to Youtube because we are addicted. Or maybe those dystopian algorithms suggest media we find worth watching. We all have choices about how we spend our time. The Social Dilemma suggests we don't have any choices to make.The word 'manipulated' came up again and again in the documentary. Users of social media are being manipulated to use the apps in a way that is not good for them. In fact, many users are 'addicted' to social media. This language reminded me of Marxist language about the 'exploitation' of workers. The word itself tells us how we are supposed to feel about the practice. If we instead said users are 'persuaded' to spend time on social media, the whole market sounds less ominous, but the meaning of the word isn't much different.As a little aside, I watched The Social Dilemma with Netflix closed captioning on. Closed captioning contains both subtitles, and also a description of non-dialogue sounds as well. When the discussion was related to suspicious practices of tech companies 'ominous music' was played. When a character in the dramatization suggests that we use less social media, 'energizing music' was played. The captioning parted the curtain a little bit so I could see behind the scenes how the film makers aimed to 'manipulate' or 'persuade' the audience into certain feelings by using musical cues.This isn't to say that there is nothing worrying about social media. The effect of social media on children emphasized by the The Social Dilemma is genuinely worrying. Children, especially pre-teen children, are not mature adults. Children are often gullible, and make poor decisions. We cannot expect them to make decisions which are in their own best interest. Social media for children should be regulated similarly to how children's television is regulated. Short of that, parents should limit their pre-teens' connections to social media, and regularly look through what they are doing online.The documentary ends with a short discussion of the existential risk of social media. That is, the chance that unregulated social media will lead to the end of humanity as we know it. This far-fetched idea is endorsed by a couple of the experts who appear repeatedly in the documentary. I am not sure I understand exactly the mechanism by which social media would end the human race, but I think the fact that several of the interviewees support it is telling. The former execs that are interviewed in The Social Dilemma all spent much of their careers thinking about social media. Since social media is their life's work, they might think it is more important than it really is.The Social Dilemma is a long diatribe, with some interesting ideas and observations thrown in along the way. I think it could have been cut down significantly, and I did not find the dramatization helpful. The mediocre documentary is boosted by plugging into the current widespread skepticism about the role of social media in our lives.

tt11464826,1,"This documentary:1) Selectively blames only technology/capitalism/profit business models/private initiatives etc.2) In parallel, it completely omits/ignores individual responsibility, which in fact is replaced by victimization. Individuals always are presented as ""innocent victims"" exploited by immoral monsters (point 1 above).3) And the cherry on the top: It proposes REGULATION as the main solution. In simple words, this documentary is based on the (unproven) belief that the solution is a gigantic Statism (more regulations, more interventions, more bureaucracy, more collectivism, more Man-in-the-middle, more liberty/freedom restrictions etc)... just because ""individuals always are weak, always are victims, and always need the Big Brother (Statism) protection"". Between hidden lines, it's like using North Korea or China as a model, where communism always is protecting the people (the weaker, the victims, the exploited, the common-good blah, blah, blah) by increasing the power of the government (in one hand), while regulating/controlling/manipulating Social Media and the whole internet traffic (in the other hand).4) In addition, the documentary totally ignores, for example, that Religion was/is/will be many times much worse than technology, Religion has existed for centuries causing colossal destruction and death, Religion always is tax-exempted enjoying countless fiscal benefits, Religion always is based on profit and power accumulation, and Religion is one of the worse exploiters of human mental weaknesses. In this same context, Statism for centuries has done (human brainwashing using political ideologies) the same as Religion did. But both Religion and Statism historically are culturally accepted, so both are never seen as enemies of humanity.Conclusion, I do not deny that Social Media/Networks are a problem. I just affirm that this documentary is selective and incomplete. The real problem is not Religion, nor Statism, nor Social Networks etc. The real problem is humanity, and their (our) tendency always to victimize themselves, never taking responsibility for their (our) actions and the consequences of their (our) actions.",The Social Dilemma,2020-09-09,7.6,67120,2020

Some good stuff ... and some very bad.
The first half, and about the last five or ten minutes ... where practical (data-driven) advice is given in terms of identifying problematic issues, and managing kids' usage (particularly) ... is good.
But I found most of the second half to be seriously condescending and propagandistic ... in respect of ""conspiracy theories"" etc.
Which is hilariously ironic, because the whole doco is basically talking about the ACTUAL (massive!) conspiracy-theory which has played out over the last 20 years to mine our attention and make users a disposable product. LOL. 🙄
Obviously I wasn't expecting much (it being a Netflix production).
But there are problematic issues, and at least they are raised in this doco ... even though the production comes with a bucket-load of stuff I think is assumptive, selectively judgmental, manipulative, fundamentally irrelevant to the main problems, and accordingly, unhelpful and a little irritating to sit through.
Overall though, it is absolutely worth watching ... mainly for reasons of being able to unplug kids before they become completely useless human beings.

Yes! They have some good arguments, but most of them are plain nonsense.
Some messages are:
""Social media shows ads and manipulate people into buying stuff as well as some"" Welcome to real world! Everything in your life has been manipulated by media and advertisement for decades (at least). How you dress, eat, talk, think. That's how media and advertisement work. Social media is just another tool.
""Social media enables fake news and polarization"". Really? How about the times before social media? We had two world wars in a decade and a decades long cold war. Who polarized people in 20th century?Before social media:
1 - Average people on the street did not have a platform to express their ideas. I don't understand how a progressive ""intellectual"" can have a problem with that.
2 - Average person did not have the chance to show their skills to the world. Media and Show business were controlled by a bunch of elites. Now, anybody can start a TV channel in youtube, or publish an independent movie on social media.
Social media enabled people to share ideas, find like-minded people, hear different opinions and many other positives. So, instead of starting a war against internet companies, why let's start a dialogue. Try and educate people, make internet safe for vulnerable people. Cars are useful, and also super dangerous.

They were doing very well on the pyschological effects of Instagram on teen girls' self esteem when all of a sudden we are ralking about tumbling democracies and, oh, surprise, influencing elections. The second third of the documentary is all about politics and Facebook. They lash out on Zuckerberg's social media, when in fact Twitter is far more toxic and dangerous.While I do too belive that we are more divided than ever as humans, of course, the filmmakers very thinly accuse Facebook and Russia of dismantling democracies. They just never mention Trump because they are too wise.So they end up doing the very same thing they accuse the social networks of doing. Trying to influence your thought and ideas about politics,, but now via Netflix (who, mind you, employ some of the very same tactis social media use to keep you hooked).Finally they get back to the psycholigical and emotional effects of the abuse of SM, and suddenly it ends with the best advice of the whole movie: Delete your social netwoks.

tt8503618,9,"Greetings again from the darkness. You know what it's like when people start talking about some great new restaurant that just opened (think back to pre-pandemic)? And then you start to hear your friends and co-workers raving about it ... best 'steamed broccoli' (ok, insert your favorite entrée) I've ever tasted! Having been burned many times with high expectations, you remain skeptical, but make the reservation. Well, that's been me with ""Hamilton."" For almost 5 years, the hype was just too much. Surely folks were caught up in the frenzy, and peer pressure was such that no one would admit it wasn't all that. So, now I'm here ... throwing myself at the mercy of the Theater Gods. Thanks to Disney Plus, I only needed to invest a little (ok, a lot) of time, rather than a few hundred dollars for a ticket. This is me humbly admitting I was wrong. The show is fantastic, and I only wish my first viewing had been a live performance.Unfortunately (because of what I mentioned above) this can't be a comparison of a live stage performance and the film version. Instead, this will briefly outline what I noticed in the movie. First, and I believe this is key, the original stage director Thomas Kail is back to direct the film. It should be noted that the film version is a blend of a couple of recorded live shows, plus some recorded songs seamlessly edited in. This is the original cast doing what they do best, and the edits are imperceptible. Second, the main cast is filled with dynamic performers. In many stage shows, one or two actors are head and shoulders above the others. Not so here. At a minimum the top seven actors are as skilled and fun to watch as any you've seen. Third, this is a true musical in that the songs drive the story. Some of the early songs require serious concentration to catch the lines, but even if you miss some lyrics, the gist of what's happening is pretty clear. These aren't so much catchy sing-along types, but you'll easily recall the scenes when you hear the songs again at a later date. We see a perfect melding of music-performance-story.Of course most everyone knows that Lin-Manuel Miranda is the creative force behind the show. He credits writer Ron Chernow's book on Alexander Hamilton as the inspiration for the production, but it's Mr. Miranda that appeared on every talk show for a couple of years, and he also performs as Alexander Hamilton. Daveed Diggs has dual roles as the flamboyant Marquis de Lafayette and the equally flamboyant (at least here) Thomas Jefferson. Renee Elise Goldsberry takes over the stage with her powerful voice as Angelica Schuyler, and Chris Jackson is a dominating physical presence as George Washington. Jonathan Groff (from ""Mindhunter"") is absolutely hysterical and unforgettable as King George III, both through song and strut. Everyone will have their favorite performers, and truly they are all exceptional, and I'd like to point out the two that took my breath away. Phillipa Soo as Eliza Hamilton has a pristine voice that will bring tears to many eyes. She may not be as involved with the political elements of the story, but in the most emotional moments, she is front and center. Lastly, the passion Leslie Odom Jr brings to his role as Adam Burr is beyond description. He may be the ""villain"", but he makes Burr accessible and easy to understand ... plus Odom is a terrific singer and performer, and he lights up the stage.It's easy to overlook the dance and stage choreography since it's never over-the-top, but the dancers are terrific and the performers make great use of the single set - although props are regularly brought in and taken away. Perhaps what really makes this click as movie entertainment is the expert use of cameras and editing. We see the full stage when we should, and we are offered close-ups when it's most effective. I do hope to catch the live show at some point, but if my Hamilton experience is limited to this cinematic version, well ... ""that would be enough.""",Hamilton,2020-07-03,8.5,60088,2020
tt8503618,10,"Having seen the play and loving it, I was set for a disappointment. No chance. With the one limitation of being confined to a screen, the portraya was extremely well done. With a minimum of close-ups, the filming of the staging worked well. The sound was very good, few words lost. Since this was the original cast, we got to see the thing at its best. I will leave it to others to get into the plot details. I was intrigued from beginning to end.",Hamilton,2020-07-03,8.5,60088,2020
tt8503618,8,"I really enjoyed this.Lyn-Manuel Miranda is widely and deservedly regarded as a genius and this musical/film adds more evidence to support that.Clever, funny, rapid-fire lyrics blend with an (until this musical was created) under regarded figure of US history. But his genius is even more evident in his decision to pitch a musical where most of the white historical cast are portrayed by Black American performers... with hip hop music at its spine. Originality is king if you want to make memorable art.The cast in this production are luminescent. They may not all be names theatre goers will readily recognise but you've seen many of them on TV and film. There's even a key figure played by a semi-regular from Glee (singing a song that sounded very Tim Minchin to me).As a huge fan of musicals I was always going to like this. The flip-side of this is that I judged it against the others I've seen and loved.So yes, its hands don at least 8 stars (and most people say more than that, and that's fine) but some of the things I regarded as flaws held me back.Relationships - no real kick-arse relationships of emotional depth except for the one who dies midway through the second act. And while it was portrayed and told well, I felt it failed to resonate as much as it could have by the lack of foreshadowing the bond. The relationship with his wife seemed tacked on and the hinted relationship with another woman (won't add a spoiler here) never delivered. The fact it was never established as fact in the real life story of Hamilton was no doubt part of the reason, but including the hint that goes nowhere served little purpose.The story - Some stories are light by nature (Grease, Little Shop of Horrors) but they at least have a powerful relationship at their base. Some are significant because of the story they cover (Les Mis, Rent)... and they also mostly have a powerful relationship or two in the midst. I know the purpose of telling Hamilton's story was to share details of an almost forgotten figure, but I kinda feel like he deserved to be forgotten. Definitely an intellect, but his role in the War of Independence was bureaucratic, his additions to legislature were significant, but again bureaucratic. If they had hung some of the story on a significant moment rather than to provide a greatest hits package of his life, maybe there was more power to be had? Having seen it and enjoyed it, I still wonder ""why Hamilton?""Anyway, those are just some of my personal misgivings and I DID love the film/musical. Miranda is the genius in this case and while it's very easy for people on the sideline, like me, to critique or fiddle with the idea, there's no idea at all without his amazing mind.You really should see this.",Hamilton,2020-07-03,8.5,60088,2020

I am so grateful this made it to the small screen for those of us who weren't able to catch the live show. Not only is just about every word sung, and beautifully at that, but the songs are done in styles to have you hanging on every word. It's the perfect amount of heavy and emotional with comedic lines and acts (thank you King George III). And while I am aware that the play does take some factual liberties, it had me googling to find out more about these people.",Hamilton,2020-07-03,8.5,60088,2020

Being on the other side of the world it never cross my mind i will be watching it. And this things barely make it out to where i am, specially not unless is dubbed... which probably will be a Catastrophe.
So when i heard Lin-Manuel Miranda saying it will be released on Disney+ I couldn't believe it. Thank you for that.About the show: it delivers and more. I had a blast watching it, time went by so fast. You won't regret it. It was done beautifully. It was enjoyed deeply.",Hamilton,2020-07-03,8.5,60088,2020
tt8503618,10,"Lin-Manuel Miranda is a genius. Such an unbelievably unique and brilliant piece of musical theatre.

tt8503618,9,"Who tells your story? Who tells my story? Talk less, smile more. Tonight I saw the musical Hamilton (2020) on Disney+. To begin with let me tell you I do know a little about the founding fathers of America, but not the story of Hamilton (1) and I am not an American, but born and raise in The Netherlands (2). And before I say more, the musical is just great.I like all the players, the costumes, the dance and the songs. When you ask me who of the five players you like best I would say Lin-Manuel Miranda as Hamilton, Daveed Diggs as Lafayette/Thomas Jefferson, Renée Elise Goldsberry as Angelica Schuyler, Jonathan Groff as King George (such a great performance!) and Chris Jackson as George Washington. Offcourse a great compliment for Miranda, who was also responsible for the story and music; he also was one of the producers.There where great scenes and songs throughout. I find the hip-hop awesome from the beginning to the end. As a not-American I had a little time to adjust, but with the capital on a little time. With the first song going I became fascinated. Okay yes, the best enjoyment would be to have been there live. Never the less, seeing it on your television has also positive things for it to say. Some scenes you can see from a different angle and you get some fine close-ups. To end, as said, a great musical I enjoyed very much.",Hamilton,2020-07-03,8.5,60088,2020
tt8503618,10,Big fan of the soundtrack and I saw I in person. The movie was better because you get a better than front row seat. It's an amazing American story told with a perfect soundtrack. I don't know if this musical movie will ever be surpassed.,Hamilton,2020-07-03,8.5,60088,2020
tt8503618,8,"I was fortunate enough to see Hamilton 3 times in Chicago, including once from the second row thanks to a friend winning the lottery. How did this compare? WAY better than I expected, honestly. I noticed new moments. I saw the original cast in a new light. I experienced the story like I was onstage. There's nothing quite like being in the theater, but this may be the closest a film crew ever got to capturing theater magic. (I wish the RENT movie had been a recording of a 1996 production...) Hamilton represents a unique moment in American theatre, and I'm grateful someone captured it.",Hamilton,2020-07-03,8.5,60088,2020
tt8503618,9,"One critic recently wrote a list of three great musicals that must be seen on stage. Hamilton was one of them.To my surprise, I have seen all three of those listed. Mind you I have only seen three musicals live on stage in my life so far. What a coincidence!I went to see Hamilton in London's West End because my kids were keen to see it. They may not know much about American history but they knew the songs by the time we got to the theatre.I did tell them if they were so keen on Hamilton, I would had pointed out where he was buried the last time we visited New York. As I did study American history, I was aware of Hamilton and especially the circumstances of his death.I did enjoy the West End show although you have to concentrate hard on the songs. Not only some of the rap parts go fast. The lyrics convey a lot of information like setting up a constitution or how to win a revolutionary war.This Disney presentation was actually filmed four years ago with the original Broadway cast. It is essentially a stage presentation in front of an audience. I understand that the British version had some slight differences with a bigger role for George III.Like the stage play Amadeus. The setting is the rivalry between Founding Fathers Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr. It spans pre revolutionary America to well after independence was gained. I noticed the rivalry was more profound watching it onscreen. This time noting that one of the signature song's, My Shot has a more layered meaning.The set for Hamilton looks remarkably simple and plain. Yet is it so cleverly constructed, some of it requires split second timing from the performers. It was astonishing watching this on television just how slick it all was.As for the cast, Lin-Manuel Miranda has become world famous as he not only plays Hamilton. He wrote the book, songs and music. The more showy role is Daveed Diggs as Talleyrand/Thomas Jefferson. It is Leslie Odom Jr who steals it as the 'Salieli' like Burr. The man who never gets to be in the room where it happens, where the big decisions are made.I was mildly amused that the American audience appreciated Jonathan Groff's King George each time he appeared with his barbed lyrics.Hamilton is a world away from the traditional musicals. This one has a modernity as seen by the music and its casting. Maybe that is a reason why it has proved to be popular with a younger audience. My daughter went back to London some months later to watch it again with her friends.",Hamilton,2020-07-03,8.5,60088,2020
tt8503618,9,"I didn't know anything about this musical other than I'd seen billboards in London's West End and wondered what it was all about. Now I know! It is an amazing production so very cleverly done. It brings history to life and makes it interesting and appealing to a younger audience which I greatly applaud. However, I can't help but think this is the American attempt at their version of Les Mis. I'll forgive them for that, nothing comes close to Les Mis but it's certainly a story to behold told in the most fabulous way. I couldn't get it out of my head and that speaks volumes so I set to researching Hamilton and his family afterwards. What a remarkable man he was. I would have given 10/10 had it not tried, in vain, to trump Les Mis. Don't even try.",Hamilton,2020-07-03,8.5,60088,2020

After hearing all the buzz about this musical about a founding father (of all the topics they could choose) for five years, I decided to spend the beginning of my 4th of July weekend watching Hamilton.Was it good?No....It was great. Amazing. I was actually blown away by how good it was. The songs are catchy (the lyrics and flow are just 10/10), the performances are brilliant, there's nothing not to like about Hamilton.I'm currently looking up everything I can about Hamilton.I think I'm a fan now!",Hamilton,2020-07-03,8.5,60088,2020

The big moments are heart stopping and the intimate ones are heart breaking.My 8 year old son, who was engrossed in his Switch, stopped playing his video game and couldn't take his eyes of the screen within the first moments of ""Alexander Hamilton"".

tt10886166,NA,"365 days is about a successful but unhappy young woman whose path crosses with that of a young, handsome mafia boss. He kidnaps her and gives her a deadline of one year to fall in love with him. Despite the rough introduction, she eventually gives in to his charms and falls in love with him. The central core of the movie is domination, or how the male protagonist uses his raw masculinity to completely overwhelm the girl until she eventually gives in to her lust, so, this movie is a very obvious copycat of 50 Shades of Grey.Now, this movie isn't exactly bad. It's not good either, mind you, but once you understand why it was made in the first place, you can at least understand its motivation. There are two ways of looking at this film:1. You try to look at this movie at a normal light, and you immediately notice one thing: it draws a lot of inspiration from 50 Shades of Grey, but it adds a completely ludicrous kidnapping scenario. It's like if 50 Shades collided at very high speeds with Beauty and the Beast, then someone filmed the tragic, messy aftermath and sold it as a movie. The first act seems pretty straightforward: the young girl is deeply frustrated with her love life and is set to meet the handsome, assertive gangster. But how the meeting goes is where the craziness starts: he intentionally snatches her off the street and holds her captive. Then tells her he will only let her go if she manages to not fall in love with him in one year. This already feels like a plot picked straight from a Law and Order: SVU episode. The explanation he gives for why he went after her in the first place just adds another thick layer of insanity to the bananas cake. The events that follow are so astoundingly bizarre that they boggle the mind. It doesn't take too long for her to accept her predicament, and after what appears to be no more than a day, she is already playing flirty games and teasing him. Once she gets her cell phone and her laptop back, she never bothers to, say, call the police, or tell her family what's going on. For half of the movie, she acts more like a girl just teasing and trying make her crush jealous, than like a woman who has just being abducted for sexual purposes by a deranged murderer. In any other context, seeing her giving in, sleeping with him and start a relationship with her kidnapper would be a horrific story of a poor woman being forced against her will and, after getting completely broken inside, accepting her fate. Seeing her mistake her inevitable Stockholm Syndrome for truly falling in love is not only tragic, it almost insults the intelligence of the viewer. The ending doesn't help either, because it tries to be somber and serious, but by the time the film ends, those two words have already flown through the window long ago. This movie seems even more baffling and out of place in our current times, the era of the fight for gender equality, the struggle for greater respect for women and the MeToo movement.I know you are thinking this is incomprehensible and bizarre. I sure thought that way myself for the first half. But then you realize you are simply looking at it wrong. This is still no Citizen Kane, mind you, but it has a very simple reason to exist.2. This movie is a complete fantasy. The female lead is in an extremely relatable situation: she has a vaguely defined but supposedly successful job, but her love life is a mess. Her deadbeat boyfriend is an amalgamation of many things that are collectively considered very bad traits for a male partner: lazy, makes tasteless jokes about her in front of their friends, doesn't pay attention to her feelings and needs and, (shocking), leaves her behind on her birthday, to go see a place they had previously agreed to go to together. He also seems very indifferent to her sexual desires, and this is the crucial part I'll get to shortly. So far, very generic romantic movie stuff. The next step we the audience expect is for a knight in shiny armor to appear and save her from the dead relationship, but this is where the normal movie stuff ends: her savior just outright kidnaps and threatens her. He takes her to his house and doesn't allow her to leave. This dangerous criminal turns out to be an extremely dominating man. He grabs her violently, thrashes her around and menacingly states that she will cave in to him. He also turns out to be very rich. He lives in a gigantic castle. He takes her to shop for expensive clothes in luxurious stores, gives her refined dinners and procures any dish she desires. He is also tall, muscular, with a gruff beard and a generous amount of chest hair. Even when she tries to tease him and gain the upper hand, he turns the tables and subdues her. He is, by and large, the textbook definition of an alpha male. When she tries to make him feel jealous by dancing with another man in a nightclub, our hero responds by shooting the offender in the hands, and frowning at her until she apologizes. And when they finally make love, it is implied that it was everything she ever hoped for - he makes her feel like a Woman, dammit. This is the moment when something clicks in your mind. This movie takes a lot of influences from 50 Shades, but they didn't come from nowhere. Let's get a little dirty here. How many of us here have played, or heard about someone who plays, fetishes and fantasies with their SOs, and how many of those fantasies usually include popular, silly scenarios like the boyfriend/husband roleplaying as a police officer, catching the bandit played by the wife/girlfriend, and taking her into custody for ""interrogation and full body search""? Then it hits you. This movie doesn't make logical sense because it doesn't have to. It's just two hours of a bland, female lead who's a stand in for the woman watching the movie, and living the fantastic, outlandish fantasy that I suppose many girls and women out there enjoy thinking about: being seduced and dominated by an otherwordly alpha male who then vigorously sates their sexual desires. This movie just uses a ""girl gets kidnapped"" scenario, 50 Shades simply went the more niche route with BDSM. Simple, nonsensical plots that serve purely to let the female viewers vicariously live a sexual fantasy.I'm going to say it out loud: this is a porn movie. It's a porno made for women. And there is absolutely nothing wrong with this. This is nothing more than a pure, sexual guilty pleasure that obviously would never work in the real world. Nothing different from a ""traditional"" porn movie. The only real difference is the public it is aimed at. A normal porn movie for men is going to cater to men's fantasies: ludicrous setups, gorgeous women gladly doing everything the man demands, explicit images of intercourse. This porn movie (and 50 Shades as well) caters to fantasies that are more common for many women: a strong, dominating male figure that takes them on expensive trips to majestic locations and is completely focused on pleasuring the woman, not himself. The only thing this movie really does wrong at this point is being marketed as a normal, traditional movie when it so clearly is not. If you are a woman, you are probably going to enjoy living this fantasy, and there is no shame in that. It just makes me realize how grossly biased the movie industry is when it comes to porn: we are okay with all the millions of silly porno flicks and videos aimed at men, but when we see a silly sexual fetish movie aimed at women, the moviegoing public collectively pops their monocles in outrage.I watched this movie with my wife and while we were trying to take it seriously, we both complained how bizarre the plot is. But once we understand what is actually at play here, we see it in a whole different light. This is a porn movie, and don't let the lack of explicit imagery fool you (there is lots of nudity however, so beware). If you are still not convinced and will still watch it thinking it is a ""traditional"" movie, don't bother, and save the disappointment. If, however, you understand and accept it for what it is, then go ahead at enjoy it.",365 Days,2020-06-07,3.2,54121,2020

It's a fantasy, yes, it's not real, we know that, but that doesn't matter. It's a safe fantasy in our minds because it's in a movie and not real. Michele who plays Mossimo does an amazing job, better than Jamie did with Christian Gray. He fits the role to a tee.As for the ending, this is part of a trilogy.

tt10886166,9,"Please let's not forget most of us grew up reading Harlequin books, Joanna Lindsey, Jude Deveraux, or Danielle Steel that had plenty of stories of pirates kidnapping ladies, or warring families taking a daughter until a truce/ marriage could be arranged, etc. But all these amazing writers wrote about strong women that didn't just do what they were told, but found a way to make the untenable situation work to their advantage. I see the same here... She doesn't go along with what she is told, he asks her to teach him to be more gentle, and more importantly he doesn't touch her until SHE says yes, and then yes, yes, God yes! but come on, She really has all the power, he got her away from a horrible situation with a cheater for a ""boyfriend"", and her feelings were clear in that great conversation with her best friend towards the end of the movie. Those sex scenes were HOT and I wish we had more like these to enjoy. Fifty Shades wasn't a worldwide phenomenon because nobody was interested in wanting to watch it... Passionflix has some pretty good movies along this line, but I really miss Rom Coms, but maybe with some HOT scenes incorporated?

tt9620292,8,"It is a bit slow moving and less exciting than the trailer suggested, but it was a very unique premise for a movie and it was done quite well. The ending was a shock!It was a great move to cast such likable actors in the roles of the predators/rapists, depicting the idea that these kinds of people hide behind their smiles, popularity, and success.It was also interesting to note that no details are elaborated about the sexual assault incidents-implying that we don't need the details to understand that sexual assault is reprehensible across the board, no matter what type.Some people say this is movie was ""anti-man"" because men are primarily antagonists, but clearly they are forgetting the female dean (represents the system), her mother (who is emotionally unavailable and self absorbed), and Alison Brie's character (willfully ignorant). Many different parties were responsible for what happened-men and women-especially when it came to find justice. The protagonist herself was in a questionable gray area too with some of her vigilante actions. Also the lawyer could be considered a redeemed character, the only one really, and he's a man.The ending was unexpected and satisfying in its own way, but definitely shocking and left me reeling for a bit after.

Nothing is done just for the sake of it and everything is like a chain reaction that pays off perfectly in the end.People don't like the third act and at first I didn't until I saw the ending and I thought it was perfect.The style of this movie. It is like a candy coloured nightmare and I love it. They light up the screen and the sets in such a perfect way. It makes every scene pop.The score and soundtrack are amazing too. I really loved that Emerald payed so much attention to the soundtrack. She wanted to make it full of all these ""guilty pleasure"" songs and like ""girly"" music to show that there is nothing wrong with that music and it is good as well.

tt9620292,7,"An ambitious and audacious film, the director mentioned wanting to combine the ""horrendous and the humorous"" which in any film would be a challenge, more so here.The tone of the film thus is a challenge, but remarkably nailed at times. The colors in it, hint at the lack of extremes. Cassie's easter egg fingernails serve as a cross-over from her good girl to Goodbar tending in the nightclub scene.Carey Mulligan's performance is fantastic capturing the dichotomy in ways well beyond her wardrobe. She is not the only outstanding actor here, Alison Brie, Bo Burnham also stood out, interesting that they both may represent opposing sides in the ""argument"" although keep an eye on which side they wind up on.And really there should be no ""argument"" but the sexual double standard as an industry standard obviously persists. I cannot tell how much recently reading Chanel Miler's ""Know My Name"" affected me while watching this. Could it be Emarald Fennell wants to take some scenes in the film way too far because we should be outraged even when things go a little too far?Waking up the next morning, and considering the slap of the film helped me appreciate it more. One hopes that is the case for Chief Justice McLovin and many more. Alas, it does not bring Nina, and so many other daughters back.One other small note on the clash of extremes: the original soundtrack set against the pop numbers underscored the sense of uneasiness.

A sign of good things ahead hopefully. 'Promising Young Woman' is one of those rare treats of a film where you simply don't want it to end. Every aspect of it is perfect. Here's the kicker though - I couldn't wait to find out who the writer/director was afterwards. To my astonishment it was a debut effort from Emerald Fennell. Incredible stuff.Where to begin with this film? I think my single favourite thing about it was the dialogue. It was so exquisitely written (and performed for that matter). So many films lack any imagination in their dialogue these days, but not this film. It can be charming, charismatic, intriguing, thoughtful, funny and a hundred things in between. Also the music in this movie was perfect. I particularly loved the Toxic instrumental and the use of Angel of the Morning at the end. This is a soundtrack I would buy.I was aware of Carey Mulligan before this film, but incredibly I had never seen a single one of her films or television shows. I was blown away by how talented she is. The range she shows in one single character in 'Promising Young Woman' is almost beyond belief. I'm not sure if this is the type of film the Academy would ever recognise a performance in, but they absolutely should.I can't say enough goods things about this movie. It hits every note perfectly.

tt9620292,7,"After sitting with this for awhile, I feel like this films tone is conflicting, that combined with a jarring ending can leave some with a sour watch. However, the acting, score, story, and cinematography are such strong highlights I feel liked this film has a very offset balancing point and therefore makes this a polarizing watch.Carey Mulligan as Cassandra was absolutely electrifying on screen and I adored her character. Even Bo Burnham surprised me with how charming his character was.This film is really stylized and beautifully colored with some appealing, sometimes symmetrical, cinematography that was very pleasing to the eyes.The story was gripping through and through, it kept me questioning certain motives / events as the film progressed especially with a lead character like Cassandra who's very complicated and has her own motives.The ending of this film for me was very conflicting however. I kind of felt like I knew where it was going ... and then it turned ... and then it turned again.

tt9620292,8,"I'm not too much of a fan of rape-revenge themed movies, because they're just so unbelievably depressing and too triggering for my taste.Although this film does have its uncomfortable moments, it is engulfed in a confetti and rainbow coloured palate that is extremely pleasing to the eyes. And despite dealing with the subject matter of rape, suicide and injustice, it does it in a way that is never hammy, never overt. It has a certain pop culture charm, ringing in cheesy songs such as Paris Hilton's Stars are Blind, to a classical ominous version of Britney Spears's Toxic.The main character is a woman riddled with trauma and cannot get over what has been done to her friend Nina, whereas her attacker lives the high life without any consequences whatsoever. Such is the way of the many rapists or murderers who escape justice, like Nate Parker, Brock Turner or Breonna Taylor's killers . They get away absolutely scott-free while their victims suffer or take their own lives - and their loved ones continue to suffer as well.This is a call to arms and a powerful film featuring a wonderful, fiery, yet vulnerable performance by Carey Mulligan.

The direction was also wonderful and playful.I can see how the central character is frustrating to viewers as she refuses to fulfill
expectations by neither taking an extreme nor taking a logical approach to solve a problem and reconcile with reality. This said, the messaging around sexual assault is handled relatively lightly so this movie may be even more frustrating for survivors.Unlike other reviewers, the end did not ruin the movie for me.

Now Cassie wanders the city streets at night, letting herself be taken home by strange men - all a part of an elaborate revenge plan... as people from her past re-surface and a chance of romance comes her way, will Cassie be able to leave her grudge behind and start anew?It is hard to write a synopsis for PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN as almost everything may be considered a spoiler. It's that kind of story! The film has generated a lot of anger as it shows men in the worst possible light. However Director Emerald Fennell must be applauded for showing that abusers have no gender (two of the four film's main villains are female). Even our heroine Cassandra is a sort of an anti-hero, although our sympathies are always on her side.This story is made complex by its script, that gives us only bits of information about what happened to Cassie in the past and what her intentions are.An important part of the film is its soundtrack- clever upbeat covers of famous hits have an interesting double meaning, enhancing the scenes.If not for the snappy dialogue, quirky characters and a sharp, not-a-scene-wasted script, this would be just one in a row of many rape-revenge thrillers that come cheap by the dozen. Instead PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN is wickedly funny, sometimes shocking, often sad, but always an irresistible thriller that pretends to be a comedy about the war of genders.Constantly reinventing itself, building on its irony and comedy sketches, the movie delivers its sucker punch when you least expect it.",Promising Young Woman,2020-12-25,7.5,51263,2020

tt9620292,10,"There have been a very few amount of films in the past year that I can remember so vividly because of so many things suck as story telling, characters & acting, music and costumes etc. This film perfects so many aspects. Carrey Mulligan gives us a performance of mixed genres. Comedy, thriller, drama, romance, she does it all and keeps the audience hooked, even when she's not on screen but is mentioned or seen in a different way. The plot has aspects that have been seen before, but overall it's an original story which surprised the whole audience in the cinema. The ending in my opinion made the film. For the audience to stay so engaged and focused in the film without its leading character for about 15 minutes just shows that the story works perfectly. The theme of revenge is one of my favourites, especially in kill bill, which I got some feels and vibes from that film in Promising young woman. The music was great as well, mixing some well known songs with a blend of dramatic beats made for some repeatable streams on the official playlist. I hope this film is recognised during award season. For me (a 17 year old guy) to love a film that's intended towards women older than me, shows how this film could please and entertain a wide audience range.

But everything from the teasers to the promotion (imagery, posters, etc.) led me to believe the movie would push the concept a lot further than it did.. In the end I feel this would have made more of an impact if it had either gone a more serious/conservative and realistic route (some situations are quite implausible), OR the complete opposite, with someone being pushed over the edge and devolving into madness/violence a la Joker/John Wick.

tt9620292,4,"I remember seeing this trailer multiple times the last few times I went to the movie theater before the pandemic started, and I found the trailer pretty exciting. I thought, ""Really interesting cast for this type of movie. This looks like it has potential, but it could go both ways...""Well, ummmmmmm, it definitely went one way, pretty intensely. Not in a good way. The characters are so hollow it almost feels weird to even call them characters. They all feel like parodies of stereotypical archetypes. The protagonist is fully unlikable, and it's the first time I've seen Carey Mulligan in a role where she's as such. Like. yeah, obviously she's ""fighting for a good cause"", except she does it in a really horrible, counterproductive manner. It's difficult to tell what the director intended for the audience to feel while watching this film. At first, it feels like it's supposed to be a fun revenge-style B-movie, but you quickly realize that it's almost never funny even when it tries to be and it has almost zero violence, so, it actually has none of the characteristics that would make a B-movie fun. I also figured it would be campy, but it's mostly camp-free as well. It feels like they attempt camp on occasion but it falls flat, especially because it's so seldom and does not match the tone of the rest of the material. I feel like the movie would work way better if these dudes were getting their heads chopped off. On a similar note, there are a lot of attempts of creating either tension or emotional resonance by way of very serious subject matter, but due to the fact that the characters and script are otherwise so one-dimensional, they mostly all fall flat as well. There's not really anyone on the cast who does particularly well with this material, but I'm gonna chalk it up more to the writing and directing here. I'm sure they did the best they could. Alison Brie probably did the best out of anyone, but she's only in two scenes.The last half hour was perhaps the only compelling part of the film, and the only part that features anything beyond surface level concepts. However, it had some pretty big plot holes IMO. You'd think the point of this film would be to make you cheer for the woman getting revenge on men, but the way it wraps up doesn't really give you satisfaction in that department, or any other for that matter. The wrap-up is intriguing and there were a couple of elements I was not expecting, but it also felt like it didn't actually make enough sense as an ending.So, not many redeeming values here.

tt9620292,5,"This film is an indie dark comedy/thriller about a young medical school dropout, Cassie, who seeks revenge on men by trying to lure them, only to put them in their place. Shaped by past traumas as well as the experiences of her friend, she feels the need to be heard and understood. While the concept of the film could have been utilized very well to create a clear parable for the #MeToo era, the film feels tonally erratic. The screenplay does mix some engaging dark humor with social commentary, but I didn't find the characters to be particularly unique or interesting in terms of their development. The static nature of some of the characters further makes the plot less engaging, and some of the attempts at ""revenge"" ultimately get a bit repetitive.The story does clearly show the moral repulsion of sexual violence, as well as the tragic psychological toll it takes on survivors. Yet the attempts at twisted humor often fall flat, and sometimes feel rather tone-deaf given some of the seriousness of the rest of the material. The film's quirky aesthetic also did not do too much for me. Its visual and musical style could be defined as ""candy-colored,"" and the pop music in the soundtrack can sometimes be a bit off-putting. While I admire the audacity of the director, I think the jarring tone and aesthetics don't always feel conducive to the much more tragic and grounded social themes embedded in the story. The ending also seemed to negate the film's tone from both a thematic and moral level, and leaves far more questions than answers (but not in a good/ambiguous way.) I wish I could say I really admired this given the strong reviews it got out of Sundance, especially given the talented cast and Margot Robbie's production company producing, but I cannot. Not recommended. 5/10",Promising Young Woman,2020-12-25,7.5,51263,2020

tt6878306,8,"I'm a big fan of Paul Greengrass and Tom Hanks, so I was looking forward to this 19th-century Western. Based on the book of the same name, it tells the story of a Civil War veteran, Capt. Kidd (Hanks) who now serves as a news-teller in Texas. He must bring a young girl, Johanna, to her aunt and uncle. The film is skillfully well-made and leisurely paced, as its tone feels almost lyrical. Its western setting is depicted as harsh and realistic, but still unique and powerful. The film's cinematography of 19th-century north Texas is absolutely impeccable. After ""Nomadland,"" it's the best cinematography of the year. From gorgeous wide shots of prairies and canyons and mountains to detailed sets of important towns at the time such as Wichita Falls, the shots look sublime throughout the film.While the film's pacing is slow, it never feels too slow by any means. In fact, such leisurely pacing feels appropriate to the more lyrical tone of the film--almost like a more gritty version of a ballad. Even though the film is obviously very tonally different from Greengrass' other films, such as the original Bourne trilogy and ""Captain Phillips,"" Greengrass is still able to build up lots of suspense at appropriate times over the course of the film--such as a scene when Capt. Kidd and Johanna must out-maneuver a gang of outlaws, a bumpy and dangerous stagecoach ride, and a desert storm. The emotional core between Kidd and Johanna is very well done, and the performances are very strong. Hanks does a great job showing a range of both charisma and grit in the role, and the young actress who plays Johanna is superb. My only criticism of the film was that the film could have developed Kidd and Johanna better as characters, although the limited dialogue between the two of them (as Johanna does not speak English) may be one of the reasons why character development within the scenes they are both together in can sometimes be a bit limited. Otherwise, this is a gritty yet gorgeous Western made with passion and talent. Gladly recommended. 8/10",News of the World,2020-12-25,6.8,48914,2020

I think it is competently made and you can tell the director knew what he was doing, i just think it was pretty average.The story is very slow, it is almost a road movie. You can see the ending coming from a mile off. I just don't know if this was a story that needed to be told.The script was pretty beige to me too. It wasn't gripping. It wasn't really passionate either. It just felt like a movie script from a western from 2006 that we have all forgot and you may have rented from blockbuster once but you don't really remember it. It just wasn't fresh.I do think the set pieces were pretty good. They looked really nice and in turn provided some lovely shots. I didn't love the colour of this film. It was very muted. I get that it was a western but it just looked really grey and washed out. Maybe this was a choice i just didn't love it.The acting was pretty good especially from the two leads. Some of the other acting was a bit over the top and out of place. Some of the antagonists seemed like pantomime villains and i also think when they were on screen the script also sagged. It turned into Saturday mourning cartoons a little bit.I do think some of the action scenes were engaging however. I think they were pretty tense and enjoyable to watch.I think you could watch this, just keep in mind it is slow. Do i think it should win any awards.

It was a bit odd how he didn't pick up his guns he tossed. And i think the horses disappeared and reappeared in one shot. But me and my family really enjoyed it. Great movie and worth seeing it.

tt6878306,8,"Tom Hanks is a 19th century newsman who reads newspaper stories to townsfolk in Texas. On his route of numerous locations, he comes across a young German-born girl who has been living under the care of native Americans who have been slaughtered. He takes it upon himself as her new guardian to escort her across the countryside to safety in the hope of finding her a new home. Along the way, they achieve an expected bond as two lonely souls in a treacherous world of danger of adversity.Hanks is great as always, as the film is told from his weary, anguished eyes. But newcomer Helena Zengel steals the film from right underneath him with a mesmerizing performance as a young girl traumatized by personal tragedy, untrusting of the world around her and just beginning to learn her communication. Together, they bring this rugged journey to life. Director Paul Greengrass makes a vivid recreation of 19th century American wilderness, a land of difficult terrain and occasionally bitter climate. Through it all, it becomes a battle for survival for both the old man and the child he is protecting.

tt6878306,7,"Greetings again from the darkness. Even in the midst of a pandemic, December is Oscar-qualifying time. And that means we get Tom Hanks' latest movie. This time out, the two-time Oscar winner reunites with his CAPTAIN PHILLIPS (2013) director Paul Greengrass (three ""Bourne"" movies, and Oscar nominated for UNITED 93, 2006) for Hanks' first ride into the western genre. Luke Davies (Oscar nominated for LION, 2016) adapted the screenplay from Paulette Jiles' 2016 novel.The beloved Mr. Hanks stars as Captain Jefferson Kyle Kidd. We know his full name because he proudly announces it at each stop of his news-reading route. That's right, even in 1870, which is before television and radio and internet, a person could earn a living reading the news. OK, so it wasn't the millions that national anchors make these days, as he was dependent on the audience dropping a coin or two in the tin cup. For this they were treated to Captain Kidd's robust presentation of news and events (and some gossip) from around the nation ... straight from the news clippings he collected during his travels.On the trail one day, Captain Kidd comes across a horrific scene of violence, and a 10 year old girl with a shock of blonde hair. She only speaks Kiowa, but the found paperwork lists her name as Johanna (the first American film for Helena Zengel). It turns out, tragic events in her family's home many years earlier left Johanna being raised by the Kiowa Indians. Captain Kidd is now on a mission to return her to her surviving relatives (an aunt and uncle), but there are at least three obstacles to his plan: it's a rigorous trip of about 400 miles, the girl doesn't want to go, and there remains much tension in the split among the post-war citizenry. So what we have here is a western road trip (trail ride) that's a blend of TRUE GRIT (minus the witty banter) and THE SEARCHERS.It should be noted that Captain Jefferson Kyle Kidd has served in three wars, including the recently concluded Civil War. He may make his living wearing bifocals and reading newspapers, but Kidd is no nerd. He handles pressure quite naturally, as we witness in chase scene up a rocky hill. The resulting shootout not only creates the first bond between Kidd and Johanna, but also flashes the Captain's calming influence. This is a soulful and principled Tom Hanks (as usual), but this time he's riding a horse and his furrowed brow is working overtime.The trip to Johanna's home coincidentally takes Kidd very close to where he once lived - a place that holds his best and worst memories. As viewers we see what Captain Kidd and Johanna don't. They are both headed back to a past they no longer belong to. Along the way, the two travelers cross paths with characters played by Elizabeth Marvel, Ray McKinnon, Mare Winningham, and the always great Bill Camp. There is nothing rushed about the story or these people. Fans of director Greengrass will be surprised to find an absence of his trademark rapid-cut action sequences, but he has delivered a sweeping epic with superb cinematography (Dariusz Wolski, ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise), expert editing (Oscar winner William Goldenberg, ARGO), and a terrific score (8-time Oscar nominee James Newton Howard). Mr. Hanks delivers yet another stellar performance (of course), and young Ms. Zengel's assured performance likely means we will be treated to her work for years to come. It's a quasi-western period piece that is plenty interesting to watch, yet lacks the memorable moments to justify multiple watches or a place among the genre's best.

tt6878306,7,"As Tom Hanks' movies go, this is a solid continuation of his work. The pace was a bit slow in some parts but I like that this was the kind of movie that had multiple sub-stories going at once that all were started and completed during the course of 15 to 20 minutes. I kept waiting for something 'devastating"" to happen but that never really came about. A bit predictable at the end but hey, when I compare it to the movie I watched on HBO Max a couple of days earlier (WW1984) this movie belongs up there with Gone with the Wind (tongue in cheek and sarcastic).But all in all, a good, decent, entertaining move but not one I would ever seek out to watch again.",News of the World,2020-12-25,6.8,48914,2020

tt6878306,5,"'News of the World' isn't a bad movie as such. But nor is it a good one, either. Although nothing is particularly outright terrible about it, well except perhaps some of the script which is dull, and especially weak dialogue amongst some of the bad guys they encounter, it's all quite unengaging, boring, and falls flat. There is very little, besides the cinematography, that really grabs you an draws you into the film. Apparently the two main lead characters bond, but I'm not quite sure when and how, because director Paul Greengrass doesn't really want to let us in on it. There's very little chemistry between the two main protagonists that gives you reason to believe that they connect with each other deep down, and not much that really made me relate and connect to the characters and their situation either, meaning that as a result, I didn't care about them. It's a shame, because I was really hoping to enjoy this movie, not least as I like westerns in general.

tt6878306,7,"The child actor who plays Johanna/Cicada is astonishing, and the world or the novel is beautifully recreated in this production. The land, the scenery, the dust and dirt and hardship. That's why I enjoyed this film. However, the script adds several unnecessary right-on additions to Jiles' restrained and humane novel. Yes, we get it, racism and slavery are bad. The dispossession of the Kiowa is tragic. But this film traffics in Noble Savage stereotypes (in one episode not in the novel, the Kiowa act as a kind of deus ex machina at their own expense for the Captain and Johanna, and it's hard to sustain belief). In the novel, Kidd does not harbor Vietnam-type guilt over his participation in the Civil War on the part of the Confederacy. Why would he, in 1870? Hanks is playing the good guy archetype he always does, very competent, but at no point did I see him as a retired Confederate colonel in 1870s Texas. He acts like a Harvard professor. The film is uncomfortable with its own source material, which becomes a bit of a problem. For example, the character of Britt Johnson from Jiles' fictional universe (outlined in several of her novels) is reduced to an anonymous symbol.",News of the World,2020-12-25,6.8,48914,2020

tt6878306,5,"It wasn't unreasonable for me to be properly excited for News of the World. The newest Hollywood western, and the first new theatrical release in about five months that felt worth taking a trip to the cinema to see, News of the World had two big talents on board: star Tom Hanks and director Paul Greengrass. If there were anyone to put a little blind faith in, it would be two men behind some of the great films of the last three decades. The Greengrass-Hanks pairing, so fruitful in Captain Phillips, is, however, pretty barren in their second outing. News of the World is a considerable disappointment from these two great artists.Based on the novel by Paulette Jiles, News of the World is simplistic to a fault. Tom Hanks is Captain Jefferson Kyle Kidd, a Civil War veteran who currently makes a living reading newspapers to busy townspeople in a sort of theatrical storytime across the country. Kidd stumbles one day upon an orphaned German girl named Johanna (Helena Zengel). Johanna was taken in by Kiowa Indians as a youngin' and has completely assimilated to their ways. Kidd figures out that she needs to be transported to her surviving German relatives, and Kidd... takes her there. That's the story for ya. Cross country road trips are not new to the Western genre, but Jiles' story strikes me as unusually thin. The attempts to create tension along the way are woeful. At two separate points along the trail, two separate groups of men show up out of nowhere just to announce to Kidd, in so many words, that they will be the bad guys for the next bit. Obviously, these characters aren't the important ones. Kidd and Johanna are.Their relationship is the centerpiece, and I can't really fault it. Hanks, the ever-reliable professional, rolls up his sleeves and says his lines with conviction as he always does. Zengel has an appropriate look; she isn't an annoying little cutie or smug growler as so many movie kids are these days, and she gives a good performance. I might even call it impressive. A scene or two or three of their growing bond hits home. These are the moments when you can see that director Greengrass kind of knows what he's doing.Elsewhere, things aren't as pretty. Greengrass' reputation is with visceral shaky cameras and documentary-style filmmaking. That's not what News of the World needs, and it's not exactly what the movie is. But Greengrass is no hack. He's also one of the preeminent masters of immediacy and excitement. Those qualities are what I miss. That is what is glaringly lacking with the approach he brings to News of the World. This isn't a United 93-esque docudrama, brimming with that sort of intensity. News of the World is a traditional story and it is shot like a traditional ""movie"". Just not as painterly or carefully composed as some. However, the only thing that directorial restraint creates is a limp, boring visual look. I think I would have respected a full lean into documentary authenticity here, or conversely, a full lean into John Ford-ian grandeur, but what we get instead is a hesitant attempt to be a little (but not too much) different from Greengrass' other works. For the most part, it's soft-focused, claustrophobic and close-up heavy, with only the occasional drone shot to highlight some dull Texan exteriors. Weaksauce. There's a way to envelope an audience in verisimilitude that Greengrass has perfected in his oeuvre (make it tight, immediate, suspenseful), and there's a way to do it on a giant canvas (look at the pictorial magnificence of something like Dances with Wolves). Greengrass and his cinematographer do neither with News of the World. You can't just point a camera at a beautiful landscape and have it transport the viewer there.Nothing grabs in News of the World. Tom Hanks is out there doing his thing, but is Captain Kidd really an interesting character? Is Hanks' performance anything special? No. The story is blah, the filmmaking is blah. It's very strange to see Paul Greengrass so lackadaisical. He seems uninterested in the material, and why shouldn't he be? The material is uninteresting. But still, there was something to salvage here. I mentioned that father-daughter relationship. It works on its own, in those individual scenes. But I trusted these filmmakers to come at it with a considered point of view. To put some kind of spin on it. To find something worthwhile in there. That didn't happen. What a shame.57/100",News of the World,2020-12-25,6.8,48914,2020

tt6878306,7,"I enjoyed this film. The growing relationship between the man and the girl is sweet and interesting. The film is somewhat episodic as they experience difficulties on their trip. My big gripe is that the part of Texas they are traveling through looks nothing like this. Many films are made in New Mexico because of financial benefits that Texas doesn't provide. ""No Country for old Men"", ""Hell or High Water"", and this film all look great, but ""News of the World"" was supposed to be in North Texas down through Central East Texas. The Dallas area is rolling black soil grassland with numerous rivers and creeks surrounded by large woods. It's farmland famous for cotton production. It's not desert. The Eastern half of Texas is Wooded with streams. Before cotton, cattle, or oil the first major cash crop to new settlers was lumber. San Antonio is on the Eastern edge of the Hill country, where there are hills separated by valleys with rock bottom, clear running streams, the most scenic part of the state. West Texas is dry desert, but that isn't where this film is supposed to be taking place. From John Ford filming in Monument valley, to Lonesome Dove, Texas is too often depicted unrealistically, geographically. It's annoying.",News of the World,2020-12-25,6.8,48914,2020
tt6878306,6,"I did enjoy watching this film on Amazon Prime's early release because Tom Hanks was excellent. But it's hard to watch how horrible the people were depicted in the post Civil War Texas. You have a lynching. You have greedy capitalists who destroy the buffalo and abuse their workers. You have evil men at every turn down the road. You have a little girl who just wants to go back to her Indian kidnappers because she likes being an Indian. Several times, I felt like the best thing for her would be to grant her wish to return to them instead of subjecting her to the American settlers. The little girl describes how everything is connected in nature in a big circle of life, while Tom Hanks says that Americans just go in a straight line and look ahead. The movie infers that there is no time to appreciate nature for the settlers. One character even says that there is no time for stories. He needs to focus on working the fields.This is not a Clint Eastwood film like Unforgiven where I found myself rooting for the most evil man in the West to kill Little Bill. The film hints that Tom Hanks' character may not be a great guy, but I never saw proof of this. I just saw someone who did his duty during the war. This is more of a story of how horrid people of Texas treated each other and the native population. It shows the resentment of the townsfolk for the Northern soldiers and the Northern President after the war ended. It was interesting how the army took away the Texans' guns and only allowed them buck shot weapons. It's a story of how the natural resources were abused with an awful scene showing an endless field of skinned buffalos.Tom Hanks is very believable as an aging man just scraping out a simple living reading the news. I thought the film was shot with a gritty reality in mind. The gun fight scenes did remind me a bit of Unforgiven in the way that it's not like Hollywood depicts when it's real people fighting for their lives. It showed us a dangerous road and an unforgiving terrain. It was worth watching, but it's a very tough message to stomach even if that's the reality of those times.",News of the World,2020-12-25,6.8,48914,2020
tt10618286,5,"But the biggest problem is the writing by the director's late father, Jack Fincher. David Fincher is a fascinating director and this is an exquisite piece of filmmaking and almost assuredly this year's Oscar winner for production design, but it's incoherent sometimes even for those who are familiar with the characters. The acting is fine by the entire cast, but no one thrilled or moved me. The cinematography is also a highlight as is the score, but ultimately a director I greatly admire has his biggest misfire. I do think that this might be one film that benefited from the pandemic. It's very hard to believe that this would have been a success at the box office. Technically it's a major achievement, but that's about it.Much to my great surprise for a Fincher film, most of this is boring.",Mank,2020-12-04,7,45357,2020
tt10618286,4,"Mank is a movie aimed squarely at film buffs that tells the story of the writing of Citizen Kane. I am a film buff. I love Citizen Kane. I am this movie's target audience. It is bad as a movie, and worse as a movie eager to be compared with the works of Orson Welles.In the film, Gary Oldman plays alcoholic scriptwriter Herman Mankiewicz, who holes up in the middle of nowhere with a broken leg and the assignment to write a full script in a month. He bases the script on the life of powerful millionaire William Randolph Hearst. In flashbacks, we see Mank's dissolute life as a screenwriter, drunk, and witticism machine, as well as his friendship with Hearst's mistress, Marion Davies.1. Mank as a movieI want to take about Mank's failures as a film for film buffs and it's failures as Welles-lite, but I don't want that to get in the way of the most important point, which is that this movie is simply dull. Oldham is persuasive as Mank, but the character is like one played by Thomas Mitchell in old 40s movie; a side character whose witticisms are fun but never make you want to find out what makes him tick.The alcoholic writer isn't an inherently uninteresting subject, but it's also not an inherently interesting one, and the movie doesn't give us any particular reason to care about Mank. The flashbacks are sometimes interesting and sometimes not, but in neither case do they change the movie from basically being a guy in a house typing and getting blackout drunk. There is nothing within the movie that makes you curious about the characters or the situation - the only thing that kept me watching was curiosity about Citizen Kane, and if I'd never seen that movie I wouldn't have finished this one. The acting is good, and Amanda Seyfried is actually exceptionally good as Davies, but there's really not much to this at all. It doesn't pull you in at the start, and the end feels as meh as the rest of it.2. Mank as a film buff movieThe best thing about Mank is the gorgeous black-and-white cinematography, which does a dead-on impression of Greg Toland's work in Citizen Kane, down to emulating specific scenes. Set and costume design are also first-rate.But as behind-the-scenes look into Citizen Kane the movie is a failure. One thing I wanted to know was why, if Mank was friends with Hearst and with Davies, he turned on them so savagely.Some say that the treatment of Davies was the thing that most harmed Kane most of all. True, Not only was it reportedly the main reason Hearst wanted to destroy the movie, but Davies, a talented light comedian pushed into inappropriate roles by her sugar daddy, was charming and well-liked (which Seyfried captures wonderfully) and threw big Hollywood parties and because of that, Hollywood would not rally around Kane as Hearst attacked it. Even Welles admitted, years later, that he had been unfair to Davies.So why did Mank trash her? The movie offers a simplistic answer involving Upton Sinclair that doesn't make much sense and, when I researched it, isn't remotely what happened. There is no thoughtful attempt to consider why a writer would use his friends as grist for the mill, even though other writers have successfully looked at the very subject without reducing it all to petty, self-righteous vengeance.The movie also falls onto the long-exploded Pauline Kael side of the who-wrote-Kane debate, suggesting Welles did pretty much nothing on the script. A little research shows scholars have conclusively refuted this (one of the top of the ""most helpful"" IMDB user reviews gives a good overview of this).The only reason I kept with this movie was for the real-life story that it couldn't bother to tell.3. Mank vs. Orson WellesBy making a movie about Citizen Kane, and making it look just like Citizen Kane, director David Fincher would seem to be *daring* people to compare his work with Welles. But it falls short of Welles work in every non-superficial way.Welles was certainly a big fan of flashy cinematography. He could be gimmicky. But there was always intent to it. Gimmicks were always both ""oh, cool!"" and ""look how that emphasizes the point he's making in a fresh way.""Beyond the flash, Welles was a filmmaker who never gave you all the answers. He gave you clues. Citizen Kane is about the search for Rosebud, but once you know what it is, you still don't know Kane. It's another clue, but it's up to the viewer to decide how to sort these clues. Welles gave you jigsaw puzzles with some pieces missing and some extra pieces. It was true of Kane and pretty much everything he did through his final film, The Other Side of the Wind. Welles did not consider people explicable. They lie about their motives to others and themselves, they change from moment to moment and year to year. It is the complexity, not the cinematographic tricks, that make Welles one of history's greatest filmmakers.But Fincher's Mank isn't complex at all. His story arc is straightforward. He's a brilliant drunk. His motives are simplistic. He's self-destructive in a predictable fashion. Like all of us he has his good points and his bad points, moments of spite and moments of grace, but then, so does every character in a Hallmark movie.And the gimmicks in Mank are just gimmicks. If you know Kane's opening scene you'll recognize the falling whisky glass as a callback, but what does it say? Not a thing. Not. One. Single. Thing.Mank is a dull, unimaginative film that is infuriating because it has so many of the hallmarks of a good one. That makes it feel like a cheat. I regret watching it, and recommend everyone skip it.",Mank,2020-12-04,7,45357,2020
tt10618286,6,"1940. Film studio RKO hires 24-year-old wunderkind Orson Welles under a contract that gives him full creative control of his movies. For his first film he calls in washed up alcoholic Herman J Mankiewicz to write the screenplay. That film is Citizen Kane and this is the story of how it was written.I was quite excited at the release of this movie. Citizen Kane is one of the greatest films of all time and the making of it deserves a movie. And here we have it, directed by the great David Fincher (Se7en, Fight Club, Zodiac, The Social Network, Gone Girl, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button) no less and with a good cast - Gary Oldman, Amanda Seyfried, Charles Dance, Lily Collins. Surely a recipe for a masterpiece?Unfortunately, no. On the plus side, the story is reasonably interesting and the cast put in solid performances. Fincher's direction is spot-on, with the black-and-white cinematography an homage to Citizen Kane.However, the plot is never very engaging. The story never really finds a centre and pretty much drifts along. It's not dull but has a listlessness to it nonetheless. The flashbacks, while adding information, don't help the momentum either, resulting in a start-stop feel to the main plot and a bit of confusion at times.The conclusion is also a damp squib and is disparaging to one of the greatest creative forces in the history of cinema. It smacks of trying to make a controversy out of nothing.Overall it's okay, but nothing more.",Mank,2020-12-04,7,45357,2020
tt10618286,4,"Citizen Kane is a name often thrown around as one of the greatest achievements in filmmaking. And to be honest, it is a work of art which is a must see for film fans. When news came out that David Fincher was making a movie about the writing of Citizen Kane with Gary Oldman as the main star, I was curious about it. This morning, I sat, watched and wondered what was the purpose of this movie?You must be an absolute fan of 30s hollywood, know the names of everyone who worked back then and really care about the little snippets of Citizen Kane's background history to admire this picture. If you don't tick all 3 of these criteria, you are highly unlikely to enjoy or even endure it. It is a film about the writing of another film and if Fincher's name wasn't attached to it, most people would have never even noticed it.I don't particularly hate this film, just find it extremely niche, self-absorbed and average. Despite formidable directing, there is nothing Fincheresque about it, just a black and white movie with decent visuals and respectable acting. The film lacks intrigue, drama or anything human to keep you engaged for 2+ hours. The movie drops random names, jumps in time and crawls at a turtle pace thinking that the audience cares about the inner workings of MGM studios and California elections in 1930s.While Citizen Kane is a highly enjoyable classic, Mank on the other hand, is extremely full of itself and is nothing but a high class Oscar bait. It is one thing to make an artistic film but it is a whole different thing to make a monotonous story without a heart that requires the audience to have an encyclopaedic knowledge of 30s Hollywood. I hope people who are giving it 10s and 9s are being honest with themselves.Movies.shmovies on Instagram",Mank,2020-12-04,7,45357,2020
tt10618286,6,"Very well made movie, great acting, but out of the more than 2 hour runtime I cared about the story for about 20 minutes. A lot of effort went into this, could have been about something a bit more interesting",Mank,2020-12-04,7,45357,2020
tt10618286,6,"Mank (2020)The movie that everyone wants to like. But why?Oh, Gary Oldman as Mankewitz is rather terrific. And the subject matter should hold water, concerning William Randolf Hearst and that 1930s world of excess, not to mention Orson Welles and that obvious Citizen Kane connection.But there are so many scenes where the writer is straining to make sure the audience is keeping up with things, for example giving us first names (and variations on first names) to clue us in on who is who. The strain of having to inform the audience chokes the intended authenticity. The scene early on where some screenwriters (including Ben Hecht) are chatting about screenplays and ideas is so forced it's embarrassing-especially since it's about screenwriting.The movie has its beauty, for sure, filmed in greyish black and white that is a softened, more detailed version of classic Hollywood. Films from the time it is set, mid-1930s to 1940, are noticably ""harder"" in tonality, meaning deeper blacks and more overall contrast. Citizen Kane is a prime example. It's worth noting that the photography for ""Mank"" is generally very poised and luminous, lots of backlighting and delineated grey scales, not much like the photography in Kane.Now you might expect the film to grow into its own vocabulary, to have a style of its own whatever the borrowings of its substance. But no, the script is stubbornly derivative and simplistic (almost as if the writers were in their 20s and just discovering Hollywood, and literature). And the reason for this is as old as the hills-the son David Fincher is adapting the screenplay of his beloved departed father, Jack Fincher. A natural mistake, but not one to put $50,000,000 on.The plot, what little there actually is, blunders along, dull as pancakes in July. The cliches abound, the supporting cast spouts obvious quips, and the name-dropping is endless and revealing. I do love Citizen Kane, and admire Welles, and I also greatly admire many of Fincher's films on another level, so it all is a disappointment.The saving grace is certainly Oldman, who acts his heart out, and sustains many scenes, even ones that don't offer much worth saving. True, he's a 62 year old playing the part of a man between 37 and 42, roughly, and that doesn't help. But he's committed and complex. A good job.And the movie isn't a total wreck...but with all the hype, it really deflates and confounds. How and why, with all this talent, did it end up so underachieving? Or then again, who really cares?",Mank,2020-12-04,7,45357,2020

tt10618286,7,"Like Oliver Stone's ""JFK a masterfully executed distortion of history
Fine acting and cinematography, but no comparison to those of ""Citizen Kane.""Fincher's villainization in MANK of Welles as a plagiarist runs contrary to the facts. To quote Robert Carringer, the expert on the matter:
""A virtually complete set of script records for Citizen Kane has been pre- served in the archives of RKO General Pictures in Hollywood, and these provide almost a day-to-day record of the history of the scripting. Once this record is reconstructed and all the available pieces of evidence are matched to it, a reasonably clear picture emerges of who was responsible for what in the final script. The full evidence reveals that Welles' contribution to the Citizen Kane script was not only substantial but definitive (370)... ""Herman Mankiewicz's principal contribution to the Citizen Kane script was made in the early stages at Victorville. The Victorville scripts elaborated the plot logic and laid down the overall story contours (398).... The Mankiewicz partisans would have us believe that this is the heart of the matter and that by the end of Victorville the essential part of the scripting was complete. Quite the contrary... Major revisions begin as soon as the script passes into Welles' hands, and several important lines of development can be discerned in sub- sequent phases of the scripting. One of these is the elimination of dramatically questionable material, especially of a large amount of material drawn from Hearst. Another is a fundamental alteration of the nature of many of the scenes; this may be described generally as a shift from scenes played continuously to scenes fragmented according to montage conceptions"" (399). (Here, the evolution of Mankiewicz's rather humdrum scenes involving Kane and Emily into the film's concise, witty, montage is a perfect example.), Yet another is the evolution of Charles Foster Kane as a character. The principal strategy is the replaying of certain key situa tions and moments in his life over and over again as a means of testing and discovering the character (399)...."":Not even the staunchest defenders of Mankiewicz would deny that Welles was principally responsible for the realization of the film. But in light of the evidence, it may be they will also have to grant him principal responsibility for the realization of the script"" (400)."" (See Robert L. Carringer. ""The Scripts of 'Citizen Kane.'"" Critical Inquiry, Vol. 5, No. 2, 1978pp. 369-400; Also cf. The Making of Citizen Kane, 985).
More interpretively. Welles was preponderantly an adapter of others work, whether from Shakespeare, lesser classics or thrillers, whether for radio theater, stage theater or film. ""Citizen Kane"" can be viewed as Welles' adaptation of Mankiewicz's ungainly, 250-page ""American,"" his first ""script"" for ""Kane.""",Mank,2020-12-04,7,45357,2020

Well, it's so beautifully artsy with amazing cinematography, many stunning shots, beautiful locations and costumes, awesome Hollywood vibes, and brilliant performances by everyone. But unfortunately all of that didn't save the movie because of its bad script. The plot is incoherent, messy, and disturbing. I really felt so confused at certain points. Mank is obviously a very well made movie but I hated it, it's just boring and uninteresting to me. What a missed opportunity!",Mank,2020-12-04,7,45357,2020

Even if I love B&M movies of the 40s, sharp dialogues and I watched Citizen Kane at least three times.I liked the photography playing a tribute to Citizen Kane, with dark, cavernous, sinister settings and also the few moments when Tom Burke (as Orson Welles) was on screen, which was not often enough.We're supposed to believe that drunkard Herman Mankiewicz, brother of the more famous and accomplished Joseph, was actually the only scriptwriter genius behind C.K. The plot twist is that Mank used to be an entertaining figure in Randolph Hearst entourage, but the relationship turned sour and Mank wrote Citizen Kane as a revenge.Mank had a reputation as a witty man, but none of his scripts were successful and his career was second rate. However in Fincher's version, Mank takes center stage and writes the Oscar-winning script while recovering from an accident and temporarily drying out.The story is told in innumerable flashbacks from which you gather Mank was a resentful drunk who unleashed his sarcasm on everybody and thought he was entitled to a better career. Unfortunately, he seems moved only by envy and I felt no sympathy.Besides the occasional sparkle, since most characters in the movie are completely forgotten, it's hard to understand fully the circumstances. The only clear things are that Mank himself did not deserve a whole movie and 2/3 of this are a snooze-feast.",Mank,2020-12-04,7,45357,2020

Perspective, interpretation and imagination are the keywords and, on this occasion, it helps if you have an interest or familiarity with some, not all, of the characters portrayed and the products of their toil and travails - as this will definitely impact your view on the rendering which, in my opinion, was enhanced by a spectacular performance from Gary Oldman, further elevated and reinforced by three stunning constructions from the supporting ladies and embellished with my ability to acknowledge fact from fiction in the name of entertainment.

tt10618286,7,"I'm a huge fan of both ""Citizen Kane"" as well as David Fincher's films, so I was extremely excited to see this. Because of how much I enjoy Fincher's films as well as how good the trailers looked, I wanted to (safely) see it on a big screen rather than wait until Netflix. Needless to say, this is a good movie, but not a great one--and it does not quite live up to the quality one would expect from a Fincher film.The story focuses on Herman Mankiewicz (Gary Oldman,) the screenwriter who worked--often tempestuously--with Orson Welles to write ""Citizen Kane."" However, the amount of time the film spends on material related to ""Citizen Kane"" is relatively little. Instead, the film tends to focus more on Mank's political activity, personal life, ascent into the movie business, and alcoholism throughout the 1930s. Oldman does a good job playing Mank, and is completely believable in the role. As one can expect from a Fincher film, the editing and cinematography are top-notch. The stylish, black-and-white aesthetic that feels both slightly understated (in the best way possible) and posh is beautifully complemented by a relatively steady camera and editing techniques common to films of the 1930s and 40s. The screenplay is generally well-written as well, although it doesn't feel as taut as you would expect in a Fincher picture, and the leisurely pacing is very well done.Despite these strong qualities, ""Mank"" unfortunately is not quite great. The film develops Mank as a character, but he is portrayed in too static of a manner to really make for an engaging protagonist, or even one that can simply have clear ripple effects on the rest of the film's narrative and the characters around him. His characterization is not especially interesting. Fincher probably uses flashbacks a bit too much in the story, as many of the flashbacks to the early 1930s don't do too much to provide additional context to Mank as a character or the time period as a whole. Also, the supporting characters (such as the roles played by Amanda Seyfried and Lilly Collins) are not especially well-developed. As a result, the film doesn't completely work as a character study. However, it is still a generally well-acted and well-shot depiction of early film history that is worth seeing for viewers interested in the subject matter. 7/10",Mank,2020-12-04,7,45357,2020
tt10618286,3,"If you took a group of random movie fans, all familiar with David Fincher's work, sat them in a theater, showed them this film sans-credits, and then asked them at the end ""who directed it?"" not one of them would say ""David Fincher."" This film is missing every single aspect that people loved about all his previous work.There is no mystery here. There is little drama. It's a film about the writing of a film, and it comes across about as boring as that sounds. To be fair, ""Mank"" never really sells itself as anything different, but seeing the Fincher name and the (ridiculously inflated) IMDB score was enough to make me think there must be something more here. Or maybe I just didn't understand it, because I certainly felt like much of the film was flying over my head, with all of the time jumps, characters appearing with little explanation like we were supposed to know who they were, and the constant 'name drops' in the dialogue of prominent people from the 1930s hollywood and political scene. For me this last one was the fatal flaw. The film takes for granted that the viewer will know all these names and backstories of people that are now obscure and long forgotten. So the entire film from start to finish has these references to contemporary people and politics flying over our heads, leaving us bewildered in their wake. If one hasn't actually seen Citizen Kane a couple times and doesn't have some rudimentary knowledge of Orson Welles, then this experience would only quadruple, as the film constantly references Citizen Kane without mentioning it by name. This film essentially has a pre-requisite: you must watch Citizen Kane first, or it will make absolutely no sense to you.But the most glaring thing missing from ""Mank"" is the distinctive dark and brooding style that Fincher has cultivated over the course of his career and that is entirely absent here. Going in, I was excited to see how Fincher would translate his style over to black and white. The answer is that he doesn't. It's just a standard black and white film. And while it looks good, I was left underwhelmed by the cinematography all the same. Something about it made me feel like it was 'made for Netflix.' In fact, the first jarring realization I had in the theater is that I was watching something in standard 16:9 wide televesion aspect ratio. Not cinemascope or widescreen. Digital, not film.

The extreme manerism and vintage vocalizations from actors is distracting and take performances from fully develope.

Instead there's this conceited drollness that assumes we're gonna love the character right off the bat because he's so... conceited and droll and sarcastic...Here they shove this boozing anti-hero in our faces without explaining what he's up against, or why he's a boozing anti-hero in the first place... It's as if the audience will adore him since it's Gary Oldman being directed by David Fincher... This Self-Aware Cinema, refusing to do any real work to enlighten the audience, is just tiresome...For a cinematic guy like Fincher, this entire movie looks and feels like a cable movie, which it is, actually, during a pandemic without theaters...

However, the movies that are anticipated have been... well... disappointing such as Tenet and unfortunately -- Mank.David Fincher is one of the best working directors with fantastic films such as Se7en, Fight Club, The Social Network, Zodiac, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera and luckily enough, he once again went above and beyond and made this movie all the more watchable. When it was announced that David Fincher would be directing another biopic (after the hugely successful Social Network) I -- like many others -- was ecstatic. In preparation for the ""New David Fincher Film"" I went back and watched his entire catalog of films. Each of his films (with the exception of Alien 3) is HIS film -- it belongs to him. With the notable yellow/blues, wide shots, static camera and the especially intriguing material, his movies are masterpieces. Then I grew worried. Mank was sounding less and less like David Fincher's other movies. It is okay to make something new and different but I wanted more dark and suspense-filled cinema. Mank was not that -- which was not a bad thing and in fact, he pulled it off! Stylistically the movie is a masterpiece but the material felt empty and that became Mank's downfall.With a David Fincher movie it is unlikely to be disengaged yet during Mank I found myself getting distracted, antsy, and even checking the time! I was confused and disappointed. The acting was great, the directing was once again great, I did not know what it was that was causing me to be so bored, then it hit me: nothing happened.

tt8784956,6,"The first 30 minutes were really promising.
Good action, suspenseful vibe, great acting... but as soon as one of the secondary character Michael appears, everything flops.
Not only because of his insecure and awkwardly mediocre acting, which reminded me of some cheap drama or love story soap opera... but because he represents an entry point into Ava's past. A boring past which has nothing to add to the story or her character.So if we crop off all the family stuff and stick to the action... then it could be a solid 7.
In stead it is a poor 6.Worth mentioning:
Jessica Chastain and John Malkovich performances are great. Colin Farrell somehow sticks to his (good) average, but who really disappoints is Geena Davis. Her approach personally felt to me like ""Let's make it clear - I'll say some words, get the money and leave.""",Ava,2020-09-25,5.4,41817,2020

tt8784956,6,"Ava is one of those films that is enjoyable, but will quickly be forgotten. It doesn't have any major or glaring flaws, but equally it doesn't have anything extra special that makes it stand out.I absolutely love Jessica Chastain as an actress, and so she was the highlight for me. I thought she brought a good performance to a character who, despite not being too developed, had enough to maintain my interest.The story felt very familiar. If you're into the action genre, you won't find anything ground breaking here. That's not to say it wasn't enjoyable. It was fun to watch, it just hasn't left a lasting impression on me.In terms of the action, once again it was exciting, but it wasn't anything new. There were some pretty decent set pieces and some good fight choreography, and the action was well paced throughout.Ultimately I'm happy I watched Ava. It kept me entertained for an hour and a half, and at the end of the day isn't that why we watch films?",Ava,2020-09-25,5.4,41817,2020
tt8784956,6,"How and why would you take a hit-man (hit-""person"" to be politically correct) genre that's been done so many times before, screw it up, AND turn it into a soap opera?I mean this whole Michael thing is straight out of ""Days of Our Lives"". Why not create a heartfelt conflict between the sisters and their mom, instead of just seemingly-random cast Common as Michael. Like my heading says, a 5th grader could've written (and directed) this better. I get that actor/trying-to-become-a-writer Matthew Newton is a newb, but to have such an all-star talent line-up, you'd think he would've at least had a seasoned writer proofread the script to avoid embarrassment. His screenplay was riddled with plot and technical issues, it was convoluted, and borderline laughable. Only in the last approx. 15 mins did it grab and hold my attention.To make matters worse, actor/trying-to-become-a-director Tate Taylor failed miserably in directing his cast, and certain scenes were horribly directed. Don't get me started on the lame action scenes. Right from the start, Jessica Chastain was unconvincing as an assassin, and I know in front of a seasoned director, she would've nailed it. Even A-list actors need direction in scenes. With Taylor, her fight scenes were phony, as was her character.I feel really bad for the A-listers having this mess on their resume. This type of filmmaking is more suited for the Steven Seagal and Bruce Willis has-been B-movie type actors. Now, watch seasoned filmmaker Luc Besson's ""Anna"", who cast (as a lead!) never-heard-of amateur actress (in her first-ever acting role) Sasha Luss, and his writing, directing and action scenes will blow your mind, especially compared to this mess! The moral of this story here is, don't blow your money on A-list actors in hopes they will make your film a success; instead, put that money towards film school, then cast a Sasha Luss type newb actor, and you'll have a better chance for a successful film. It's a very generous 6/10 from me - mostly out of pity for the A-listers.",Ava,2020-09-25,5.4,41817,2020

This one has the full on assassin 'industry' structure of John Wick, but never reaches those heady heights.Chastain and Malkovich turn in good performances and Colin Farrell doesn't do a bad job either.The human element of this film centres around Ava returning to her home and family who have all changed significantly since she left, but this emotion pit is an element of the film that doesn't work so well, although Gena Davis still puts in a good performance there.The sub plot around a bizzare love triangle never really does anything but slow the film down and the gambling issue alone could have provided what was needed without all the additional angst.It's certainly not a bad action film. The fight scenes are well choreographed and don't resort to Matrix style martial arts, and the characters slow down as the fight continues which is something a lot of action films get wrong.It doesn't do anything new for the assassin genre but its not the worst film in it.

Problem (in my eyes) was the plot that did make this flick and all action thriller. Because the tears and the telenovela subplot deflate the excitement, preventing the film to reach an awesome peak that would have made it truly memorable. That - sadly - did not happen.Nevertheless, the Ava is acceptable, probably the best in offer in cinemas right now. I'd say it'd be worth of your bucks and time.",Ava,2020-09-25,5.4,41817,2020

As a fan of Colin Farrell, i got disappointed. Well, he is in good shape but the footage is very less.

Gena Davis played an assassin in Long Kiss Goodnight n sad to see her in bad condition, very old n with those plastic surgery lips.

tt9777644,6,"There's a lot of really cool stuff going on in this movie, but the directing and writing gets in the way. Ultimately, the movie tries to link the Viet Nam war and racism, and fails miserably. In trying to fight the two different wars, it loses a lot.There's a lot of issues with the movie, but they come down to three issues:
1) It needs to decide which movie it's remaking. It basically tries to combine Treasure of the Sierra Madre, Apocalypse Now, and Three Kings and fails at it because of how different the three movies are.
2) The length; this movie could have been told much more effectively in almost half the time. I know it's trying to combine three movies, but that's no excuse for just taking too much time on things.
3) The over-the-top racism. I know this is a weird call, but the movie could have been a lot more effective had it toned down the racism. Also, some of the incidents involved contribute to the length of the movie without really adding anything.The apparent lack of any military knowledge on the part of Lee (the sheer number of military gaffes, such as salutes and ammunition) as well as the obvious call-backs to movies involved keep throwing watchers out of the movie.This had the potential to be an incredible movie, especially as the acting is incredible and the cinematography is gorgeous, but it's just too long and too many issues to be even a satisfactory movie.",Da 5 Bloods,2020-06-12,6.5,41761,2020
tt9777644,1,"Give yourself five minutes of this shameful farce, and anyone who has any understanding of Vietnamese culture and history will be dumbfounded by the sheer stupidity of this movie.
I have spent 20+ years of my life dedicated to Vietnamese culture and history. I have spent several years in Ho Chi Minh City where much of this movie takes place. I'm fluent in the language, and have even been to Majestic hotel and been to ""Apocalypse Now"" (dumb bar) in HCM City.... This movie uses that place as a cheap reference to American popularity, amongst a sad and pathetic representation of a culture that - in this movie's eyes - is still primarily focused on the Vietnam conflict. This isn't really the case. There are rare occasions throughout the years where I've felt that the repercussions of the times from 40+ years ago have a daily affect on the people of Vietnam. This movie wants to thrive on the idea than any and every thing that happens in this country is based on the U.S.' influence and actions from the past. They haven't completely moved on, but I will say unequivocally that ""Da 5 Bloods"" is one of the worst kinds of exploitation: The idea that America is the fault of Vietnam's current state in the world, and that they are still focused on past events to the same level of strength TODAY as it was even 30 years ago. This is a big, fat, egregious lie.
The scene in the opening of the movie, when they're at the Apocalypse Now bar (which is a total knockoff bar for unknowing foreigners who don't understand Vietnam at all), and a guy with a missing leg asks for money saying ""GI, you GI"".... holy moly that was the end before the movie even began. Then it proceeds to the next scene, where one of the characters meets an old lover, and he meets the woman's daughter, who is obviously half-black, and half-Vietnamese.... it only gets more maudlin and disingenuous after that.
This is one of the most insulting representations of current-day Vietnam culture that I've ever seen. It's self-serving, and ignominious in ways that makes the cliches of the implications of U.S. actions in past world events end up being used for the most arrogant and self-serving messages to supplement a cheap message from an ignorant mastermind that thinks this movie has a story to tell. This story is false from scene one, and only gets more embarrassing as it progresses.
When you have a story based on a false premise, it makes the entire experience an indigestible proverbial hairball in the throat, incapable of being accepted as something which can be consumed by normal means.
This is a pathetic, sad, dishonorable mess of incoherence that doesn't understand even the most basic requirements to represent Vietnamese culture. That in itself is an affront to moviemaking. It only gets worse from there.",Da 5 Bloods,2020-06-12,6.5,41761,2020

Death of friends? Move right along. How does the black-white struggle mean anything in a foreign land where both colours killed the locals? Is that struggle a greater horror than what was perpetrated in country? Was the war just a stage for race relations? Or was the movie about the soldiers and their friendship?

I would've appreciated these messages if they weren't served to me with a spoon.I feel like the filmmakers in the editing room said ""apocalypse now was a great Vietnam war film.

What's going on?! There are some cringe worthy, unnatural conversations, some Tarantino'ish bloodbaths and an Indiana Jones-like gold hunt, not in a good way. Also there is plenty of more or less known historical footage pressed in often too hasty, so it is necessary to pause every now and then to be at least able to read the text. I find this technique of film making for a fictional story quite lazy, especially if it's used so excessively often. (Other than with documentaries) It's too easy to make a film catchy by using real, uncensored footage of brutal events like executions.At least I watched the whole movie, but not at once. Needed a break in-between.In general I love the older Spike Lee's. After a long time and the high praise of the media I just expected a more genuine, profound, realistic, if too still artistic approach to this important topic.Concluding the only clever and genuine thing were the scenes, which looked like flashbacks, just with the same old characters playing themselves at war back then...first it felt strange, but I interpreted it as dream sequences caused by PTSD.

A movie that attempts to explore the racial inequities of the Viet Nam war, the effect on friendships of worshiping gold, the importance of family, the merits (or lack) of the Trump administration -- what did I miss? -- is unlikely to do a good job on any of them.Unlike ""The Green Book"" or ""Blackkklansman,"" which present narratives on racism effectively through well-crafted films, Da 5 Bloods is a heavy-handed, often preachy and disjointed commercial that self-dilutes the impact of what it tries to say. The end scenes of various organizations receiving huge gold-fueled donations includes Black Lives Matter, which seems to be presented as an afterthought. The story is predictable, and plays out like it was written for a high school literature class the night before it was due.

Now, if you are expecting Da 5 Bloods to be a movie in the sense of a story with a beginning, a middle and an end, it might not work for you.
I am not sure myself it worked for me but I didn't feel like I could just ignore it either.
This is like a pile of political, emotional and historical statements not necessarily linked in one single bundle. At times it ends up being a Tarantino-like mess, but with relevance.
It is surely timely, it is heavily politically loaded, it is emotional and intense, angered but also ironical and lighthearted at moments.

tt10682266,7,"In 2020 you would think people would know what to expect from Adam Sandler's (effective yet slightly hated) brand of raunchy and quick witted humor. But still there are so many smug types that somehow ridiculously expect some huge swings into left field for his Netflix original comedies. Obviously he's shown incredible versatility in his career but people should be able to gauge by the trailer and it being part of his Netflix contract that these aren't Punch Drunk Love, Reign Over Me, or Uncut Gems. Know what you're getting. The snobs that hate Sandler are the types that would go into an Applebee's and expect a five star meal.This film sticks to classic Sandler formulas which isn't an issue imo. A humble basic story about an odd yet lovable main character that finds himself in the middle of a series of hilarious problems. Along the way he runs into other weird zany characters and maybe a few villains that join in on or his hilarious antics. The actors are the usual Sandler friends that he's had in other films.Overall its just a nice comfort Halloween themed Sandler comedy that shouldn't be taken so seriously by snobby critics that can't grasp the point of these films after all these years.

I tried to make myself laugh a few times throughout the film, but I just couldn't. I believe the film's cast and Netflix's marketing made gave this film, much more exposure than it truly deserved.I enjoyed a lot of Sandler's films in the 90's and early 00's, but this film was completely horrible.

I've watched Adam Sandler movies since Billy Madison came out in 1995. I believe this is the first movie with Adam Sandler and Julie Bowen since Happy Gilmore (1996) and I really enjoyed seeing them work together again after over 20 years. There are some Easter eggs hidden in this movie that connect some of Adams older movies, it was a nice stroll down memory lane when I noticed them, I don't wanna spoil them for you so see if you can spot them!
If you're looking for an Oscar nominated picture possibility then this movie isn't for you.

Tried to fight past that to see some really gross stuff that wasn't funny and clearly just looking for lazy laughs.Usually in these movies there is a good turning point where things start to go better for the main character, until ultimately the movie finishes with a conclusion making you feel like the main character ""won"".In this movie, everyone loses.

3-The film has good pace and never gets boring.

tt10059518,5,"There's nothing wrong a decent thriller where two people face off on the road using their wits and their heavy machinery. So this movie could have been the Duel (1971) of the 2020s (or at the very least a Joy Ride (2001)), but unfortunately, it lacks a director like Steven Spielberg or John Dahl to make it work.After a shocking opening scene, director Derrick Borte starts off nicely with a disturbing montage that shows us the horrible consequences of explosive aggression and road rage. For a long time, his movie seems to be a passionate plea to have more patience and compassion with others in a harsh society where everyone is under constant pressure, because you never know what the other person is going through. Too bad that he gradually undermines this message with cheap shocks and sadistic violence.It's good to see Russell Crowe again after such a long absence, because watching his heavily disturbed maniac snap and terrorize a lady that just happened to piss him off is definitely one of the scarce highlights of the film. No Oscar material, but the man is still an acting heavyweight (no pun intended... well, maybe a little), so much so that leading lady Caren Pistorius cannot hope to carry this movie in his presence. In fact, her character is so passive and uninteresting that I felt very little sympathy for her plight. I don't know if it was the intention here, but I always love movies where you cheer for the bad guy for a very long time, like Face-Off and Law Abiding Citizen; everyone loves tragic villains, and you always hope that the makers can delay that moment where you lose sympathy for them until the very last.Unfortunately, this moment comes way too soon in the movie. In the first half we get some motivation from Crowe's and Pistorius' character for their actions, but that wears off quickly in an endless rampage that seems to be an excuse for a lot of torture porn. There is nothing fundamentally wrong with that, as long as you keep developing your key players. Especially psychopaths work best when they remain completely unexplained mysteries, or when they get fleshed out properly, like the psychologic-meltdown classic Falling Down. However, Crowe and Pistorius never get beyond their minimal and one-dimensional backstories. When the bad guy gets to the point where I no longer rooted for him (again, way too soon), you hope that your allegiance changes back to the heroine. But Pistorius' character keeps making such bad decisions (up to and including a laughably set up climax) that by that time, I no longer cared about either, and could only worry about the collateral damage.Too bad for Crowe and Jimmi Simpson, who probably have one of the best scenes together when this movie is still promising. But the pressure to marry action with psychology, and to increase the stakes with such disregard for realism really starts working against the film and characters. I don't mind violence in movies at all, but it should make me invest in characters, not get desensitized and bored.I like a good battle of character like everyone else, but when the action and suspense start feeling stale because I'm no longer emotionally engaged, then it's just mostly a waste of time. But granted, it's not a complete disaster and it had its moments. I hear people praising this movie as super-suspenseful, so by all means, try it out.

What are the odds of someone living through something like this vouching for the realities of the situation? In all honesty, most of us like to think we know what we would do but is there a chance that the pressure, fear and self preservation of the moment could alter our decision making skills? I think it could and I chose to look at films like this with that in mind. These were the decisions they made in the moment and only the absolutely absurd should fall into a category of unrealistic.I liked this. Russell Crowe was fantastic in his portrayal of a fed up lunatic. He really did a great job. I thought the story could have benefited with a bit more backstory on the characters but it was decent. The action scenes were well choreographed and the special effects were nicely done. It was a tense ride for sure and it got pretty brutal at times. I'm a horror buff so that is right up my alley but I read a review that described it as torture porn and it's not that bad unless you are a total lightweight.I know this will be a film I watch more than once.

This movie just had zero redeeming qualities, i was perfectly ok with just walking out because i could care less what was happening or going too.The movie was basically torture porn, over the top unrealistic moments designed to shock the audience but it just falls flat on it's face. Also zero interesting dialogue, coupled with super generic progression and ending. I can see why they wanted to make this one of the first movies to come out since COVID-19 to sucker people into seeing this hot trash, otherwise this movie wouldn't make a dime.

tt10059518,3,"Seen an ad on local television about this movie, couple months ago. The first thing I thought then, despite Mr. Crowe's face in it, was: ""Man, this movie probably sucks a lot, if they're showing an ad on the national television!"". And I was right...I see people in other reviews are complaining about the acting. That wasn't bothering me at all... Knowing this is going to be an psycho-action-movie - I was prepared not to expect any brilliant acting.I was more bothered about the lack of police forces... They miraculously vanished in the US for this action movie. Is this the new Great America of which Trump was speaking about? (giggles)I mean.... Come on!! He killed 2 people and sat a house on fire, the cops know who did it and what vehicle he's driving. Only for the double-murder at the beginning they should've lock down the whole city and chase the killer. But they didn't..... Not even after he killed another man in front of dozen people, inside a restaurant! He was sitting there torturing that man at the table for few minutes - more than enough for 20 cop cars to arrive at the place and to block the entire area. Zero cops has arrived. No one called them? Why? People were too busy posting the video on the internet? Ridiculous.At the gas station they didn't called the cops because.... they'd be too late to respond? For real? What happened, America? Ridiculous.Also, there wasn't any of those famous armed-citizens who stop killers and stuff. No one even screamed while he was killing that man on the table nor tried to stop the killer after he broke the man's nose. Why?! Ridiculous.Then that funny road chasing has begun. Both cars were speeding, but that still wasn't enough to catch cop's attention. There wasn't a single patrol car looking for the escaped killer. He started hitting and pushing mother's car beside tens of cars and witnesses and no one even noticed? And again no one reported that the killer's vehicle been spotted. He blocked a main road with tens of cars in the traffic and still no one called the cops. Ridiculous.Why he was standing still on that crossroad, at first place, anyway? It was really weird they didn't show him at least doing something in the car, or speaking on the phone, or be distracted by doing something so we can understand why he was so pissed off to start chasing her and wanting to kill her entire phonebook. Ridiculous.He got shot in the shoulder 2 inches above the heart and he still could run away like a boss, drive a car, speaking on the phone while driving, stole another car, and miraculously stopped bleeding. And still did not got chased by any cops. Ridiculous.The mother got punched in the face couple of times without bleeding? We saw what he did at that poor guy in the restaurant - he should've killed her with his massive punch! But she stood up just few second later and wasn't even hurt or bleeding. Ridiculous.On the highway they spot a patrol car and instead of she starts hitting the honk (she knows how to!) - they opened windows and started waving and shouting at the cop, without even pointing to the back where the killer is. Ridiculous.Why Russell Crowe even agreed to play in this movie? Only he can answer....I think 3/10 is a fair rating for this one. I've seen much much worse. It was an action-thriller and it indeed provides some action with some thrilling scenes.",Unhinged,2020-08-21,6,38181,2020
tt10059518,1,"I groaned as much as crow did in this film and I think my cringe bucket is over flowing. Bad acting, predictable, unrealistic, poor continuity.

tt10059518,NA,"An unstable man under a lot of life stress confront a woman who's having a bad life and a bad day at an intersection. In it what can be cured with a simple apology, yet out of arrogance escalates into a hellish nightmare as the woman's whole life becomes a target of the man's rage.
Out of technicality, the plot is quite simple with few logical gaps. with that in mind and aside from the ridiculously bad choices which the female lead makes across the whole movie not to mention her passive boring personality...Yet with a raw chilling performance from Russell Crowe who owned the aggression and hate of his role, he single handedly managed to elevate the movie to a notable level of thrills, entertainment and excitement. The director succeeds in painting some interesting surprises in the car chase scenes and an over all thrilling experience that is worth watching.Unlike some views, I experienced this movie from a different point of view, to me the whole idea revolves around the concept of decency and common courtesy among mankind that most of us lost, maybe the fake bubble of freedom and personal rights that we live our daily lives in or how awfully some were raised on a fake racist patriotism which believes that a certain nationality/race is above others or or or. All are false reasons to be rude, mistreat others or lose compassion and courtesy for one another.
Either you watch Unhinged for the thrilling entertainment or for the eye opening message the results is quite satisfying on both ends.",Unhinged,2020-08-21,6,38181,2020
tt10059518,8,"Wow. I wasn't expecting that. Absolutely brutal thriller with a powerhouse performance from Crowe. It's like a cross between Falling Down & Duel & escalates the tension really well, especially as the sound design is especially prominent helping to portray the heightened sense of drama. The opening credits are there to remind you that escalating violence is on the increase and this plays out as a frightening scenario as to what could potentially happen. I'm never using my car horn again.",Unhinged,2020-08-21,6,38181,2020

tt10059518,8,"I am a big fan of Falling Down n Michael Douglass' portrayal of a middle class man reaching the point of no return.
While Douglass' character is sympathetic n the way he handles the neo nazi is heroic, the character potrayed by Crowe in this movie is plain psychotic.
While Douglass' character jus wanted to visit his daughter n fights for the rights of consumers, Crowe's character is a murderous lunatic without a leash n heavy on drugs.
While the character of Douglass is a simple guy with simple taste, the character of Crowe is wearing a nice Shinola watch.Comparisons with Falling Down, Duel, Joyride, Changing Lanes, will crop up in most reviews.
As a thriller, this one moves at a fast pace, has tensions n chills throughout.
The first 4 mins sets up the dark tone, the movie has two brutal n terrifying road accident scenes.This movie came at the right time when majority of fellas r unemployed due to Covid. One study states that symptoms of somatization, depression, and anxiety were significantly greater in the unemployed than employed.",Unhinged,2020-08-21,6,38181,2020
tt10059518,5,"Ok, so I'm a fan of Russell Crowe. He has done some truly magnificent work over his distinguished career. However this movie is definitely NOT one of them. It's a psycho thriller with a plot that keeps you interested, but sadly that same plot is riddled with holes and incongruous events. The lead characters aren't for the most part ""believable"", and there are multiple flaws in production. It is also an extremely violent film in parts - yet needlessly so. Having said all of that, it does make a very bold statement about the deterioration of American society into a race of ""proud, angry and intolerant"" people. Glad I saw it (it was the only original feature film on at our cinema!), but won't be seeing it a second time.",Unhinged,2020-08-21,6,38181,2020
tt10059518,2,"It started out with promise, but the unrealistic way that the entire remaining hour of the movie unfolded was actually painful to complete. It's just, it was about the dangers of distracted behaviour while driving mad how people are taking things in their own hands resulting in road rage and accidents, BUT, it completely ignores human behaviour. There is NO way that he wouldn't have been caught 150x over before he killed Andy, let alone the entire scene at the cafe where police would have been there before he left the building. People are glued to their phones, he would have had 100's of people reporting his location. AND THEN there's the phone call to the police from the tablet ""were busy and can't get to you"" 🤣🤣🤣 WHAT?!?

tt2222042,7,"Everyone involved in the making of this movie should be proud. Yes the plot is simple and it's been done many times in this genre and several others, like for instance The road, or The book of Eli or 28 days later... But in this case more like Zombieland if it was rated PG-13.
Dylan O'Brien plays Joel, a character much akin to Jesse Eisenberg's ""Columbus"", a kind of neurotic and unwilling protagonist out of his depth, who is rescued by Michael Rooker (playing Woody Harrelson's ""Tallahassee"") the grizzled survivalist with the adorable Minnow (Arianna Greenblatt playing Abigail Breslin's ""Little Rock"") in tow, whilst on a quest to find his love interest Aimee (the lovely Jessica Henwick playing Emma Stone's ""Wichita"")... Confusing?
Not really. It's a post-apocalyptic road trip monster filled action love story movie that is a romp and a riot.
It's not often you get to see a movie where even it's weakest link is still holding strong... The dialogue is witty, the scenery is beautiful but appropriate, CGI game is strong most of the time, and cinematography crisp & clear, no lightening cuts and shaky camera. All the cast brought their A-game.
Hero and Dodge lent so much emotion to their joint portrayal of ""Boy"" the dog, they both must be very good boys... and Mavis the robot could almost pass the Turing test.
You may have to suspend belief a bit in a couple scenes... But just remember you are watching a movie with giant frogs and snails and it shouldn't be too difficult. For me it's a 7 but a strong one.",Love and Monsters,2020-10-16,7,34797,2020
tt2222042,8,"""Monster Problems"" has action, fantasy, comedy, survival and even love. It is a film for the whole family, but it manages to be quite tense, especially in action scenes involving monsters.The characters are excellent. Dylan O'Brien proves once again that he can be a one-man show, Michael Rooker is great as ""Michael Rooker survival samurai""; and the dog is just fantastic. Other secondary characters also do not fail.The design of the creatures is perfect; and adorably scary. And the main theme of the film, which basically tells the story of a person leaving the suffocating comfort of his hiding place to find something that makes him happy, in the midst of a pandemic of monsters, I think it is something that will touch the sensitivity of many people that now live the dramas of self-isolation.It's the best post-apocalyptic film I've seen in a long time, a pleasant surprise that came out of nowhere, and I recommend it to everyone, even the cynics.I give this movie 8 stars out of 10.",Love and Monsters,2020-10-16,7,34797,2020

It avoids many clichés that inhabit the genre, with small twists which made watching it a pleasure.Even though the action scenes were sort of predictable, it didn't deter away from getting absorbed into Joel's story and caring what happened to him and the other characters. It had some small lessons in it too, which added to the story.Its a little too adult for young children in my opinion. Young teens though would enjoy it.",Love and Monsters,2020-10-16,7,34797,2020

Yet, he cannot get his girlfriend out of his head, luckily his girlfriend also survived, but is at a camp 126km from his camp. He takes the journey to go to his girlfriend fighting mutated cold blooded animals and insects. The mutants are great, very well done. What this movie almost brings down is the childish script and jokes, the main character, the teenage boy, is constantly denigrated for no reason, even a little girl he meets on his journey insults him only for a couple of poor executed jokes.

tt2222042,8,"Right, well I had virtually no idea what I was getting into when I sat down to watch the 2020 movie ""Monster Problems"" (aka ""Love and Monsters""). But I must admit that I was genuinely interested in the movie given the presentation of the poster.And now that I have seen the movie, I must just say: wow!""Monster Problems"" was definitely a wonderful surprise of an entertaining and enjoyable movie. It turned out to be one of the more memorable and entertaining of movies that I have seen in 2020 - and I watch a lot of movies.The storyline told in ""Monster Problems"" was pretty straight forward, but it was at the same time a very interesting storyline that definitely appealed to me in many ways, especially since I have always enjoyed a good creature feature. And with the sheer size of the creatures in ""Monster Problems"", then I was in for quite the treat.Sure, you can say that the main plot was somewhat sappy and a bit on the simplistic side, perhaps appealing more to a younger romantically hazed audience. But the combination of the sappy romance, mixed with the action, suspense and monstrous creatures actually made for quite an enjoyable cocktail.Visually then I was without a doubt impressed with how ""Monster Problems"" turned out. The creature designs were just spectacular and they looked very realistic in the way they moved, behaved and appeared. So the CGI team definitely delivered some nice eye candy with this movie.The acting in the movie was good, and was definitely impressed with the performance of lead actor Dylan O'Brien. I was not familiar with him, but he was really great in this movie. I think it was a shame that Jessica Henwick and Michael Rooker weren't given more screen time, because they brought a lot of good things to the movie with their performances and their characters. And the dog Dodge (playing Boy), well he was just spectacular, what a well-trained dog, and it had such great on-camera presence.I can warmly recommend that you take the time and effort to sit down and watch ""Monster Problems"", because this movie was great. I was genuinely surprised and entertained with what writers Brian Duffield and Matthew Robinson managed to deliver.My rating of ""Monster Problems"" is a sure eight out of ten stars.

But i really don't understand the hate; when i want emotion i see Cinema Paradiso. When i want to be really scared , i see the exorcist....

tt9619798,6,"The Wrong Missy (3 out of 5 stars).The Wrong Missy is a fair comedy film that is filled with stupid humor which is what you can expect from a Happy Madison production. A comedy movie that does have that typical predictable story and cliches but it is kind of entertaining.The plot follows Tim (David Spade) who had a bad blind date when he met Melissa (Lauren Lapkus) with her loud, obnoxious, and weird personality. Months later, he meets another woman Melissa (Molly Sims) which her personality is like his dream woman. They swapped numbers and went there own ways in the airport. When his company is throwing a retreat in Hawaii. He decides to invite Melissa. Which he gets a surprise in the airport when Melissa from the blind date shows up. Which she tries to take charge of every situation she is in at his work party.It is a predictable plot which you can tell who is going to get with who before it happens. Tim has an enemy at work which she hates him and is always trying to be better than him in front of there boss. She will be a conflict to Tim's secret about Missy and his dream girl Melissa. Tim and Missy are the opposites. He is quiet and passive. She is loud and clumsy.Missy played by Lauren Lapkus is entertaining. She may act stupid and have that loud personality. Sometimes her performance may be overboard trying to get laughs. Which may be annoying than funny. She did decent with the character. David Spade, Molly Sims, Nick Swardson, and even Rob Schneider did decent with the performances. May not be great acting. But they are all entertaining with having fun with their characters.If you seen previous Happy Madison production movies that Adam Sandler produced and enjoyed it. Than you will enjoy this as well.

tt2235695,3,"I love the novel, as so many people do, and I find it rather disappointing to watch it be wasted on such a bland and uninteresting movie.First of all, Lily James is far too charming and beautiful to play a convincing Mrs. De Winter. Don't get me wrong, she is lovely in every single way, but that's the problem! Mrs. De Winter is supposed to be an ordinary and insecure young girl, but Lily just reeks of confidence and beauty! The film does it's best to dress her down in plain and colorless clothing but it's no use. She simply has far to much personality to come across as someone unnoticeable. No way near the pale and reticent girl we follow throughout the book.Armie Hammer is a couple of years her senior, at best. The whole plot of Rebecca is built upon the insecurities of the new Mrs. De Winter, and that includes the very noticeable age gap between her and Maxim. In the film, this is completely left out and we are given none of these power dynamics whatsoever. They look as if they could be the same age!Kristin Scott Thomas is brilliant as always, but she comes of more creepy than anything. Mrs Danvers is supposed to be mysterious and cold, not explicitly evil like some kind of devilish caricature. There really is no need to give this character away so early in the film. The suspense of whether or not Mrs. Danvers was evil or if it was all in the main characters head was half the fun of the book.The movie also does quite a terrible job at making us wonder whether or not the previous Mrs. De Winter is haunting Manderley or not. In the book, us readers are given a decent amount of time to ask ourselves this very question. Is Rebecca actually terrorizing the main character? Is her ghost wandering the grounds at night or even planning to return with the help of Mrs. Danvers? It's a ghost story without an actual ghost, which is part of its brilliance.Never mind this review if you like soapy Netflix versions of things. Like most Netflix productions it looks really good and has very good looking actors in it.",Rebecca,2020-10-21,6,32017,2020
tt2235695,5,"I don't understand why you would attempt to remake a film who's shoes are just too big to fill.First off the film looks great especially the scenes in France and the story is good but that is the source materials fault not anyone involved with this film.I thought it was pretty bland apart from the points above. The characters were just so blah. I literally cared more about Clarice the maid than the lead characters. She seemed nice which is at least an adjective, I can't really think of any adjectives to describe Mr and Mrs de Winters. So that tells you something.I was really looking forward to the costumes too but for the most part I was let down. They stuck Mrs de Winter in like dumpy hats and cardigans that you could go and pick up from H & M. I don't understand this choice. In the Hitchcock film they give her interesting dresses and stylish tops. I was so confused.I also don't believe the reviews that say this captures old Hollywood. I didn't feel it, it 100% felt like a 2020 film. If you want a old Hollywood movie just go and watch one.I would honestly skip it, it was pretty confused. The first chunk of the movie felt like full romance but then it shifts into like a boring drama then it's all like Frankensteined together with horror tropes like ""jump scares"".

tt2235695,5,"It just kept me going back and forth, and I thought I'd land in a good place in the end, but no.The first half was good, but the second half is when everything started to fall apart for me.Without revealing too much, in the second half, especially towards the end (like the last half hour), the dialogue turned awkward & inconsistent. The events including significant revelations were RUSHED so much that there was no build up to them nor enough time to let them sink in before moving on to the next scene. The reactions to some news or events within the plot were dull & lacked sincerity and passion.The editing for those scenes didn't help either. It just kept jumping too fast to the next scene or cut to a different frame in a different location in the middle of a revealing conversation. That's when they lost me. The emotional connection I wanted to feel for the characters kept being interrupted.Though I still kept an open mind and was hoping I'll be pleasantly surprised that I'll love this movie by the end of it, but unfortunately, it just kept going the same kind of direction till the movie was over.I've been looking forward to this, and even with my expectations being reasonable and not too high, I still didn't get what I wanted.And just to be clear, I'm not comparing this to Hitchcock's version.

tt2235695,6,"A good story is like a roller coaster of hills and valleys. The hills build suspense and drama and the valleys provide relief and relaxation - and enjoyment. This movie has no valleys and no enjoyment (or very little). The original story by Daphne Du Maurier is of a charming ingenue orphan who meets and falls in love with a mysterious, haunted, sophisticated, aristocrat - Maxime DeWinter. This interpretation is a hero's tale of an abject mouse who survives persecution to rise up over her tormentor, becomes a heroine who thwarts a police investigation to save her husband from prison and even attempts to save her persecutor (Mrs. Danvers) from a watery grave. The main character is so pathetic from the start it is hard to imagine why DeWinter falls in love with her. The transformation from mouse to feisty heroin who beards the lion (Danvers) in her own den is unbelievable, not to mention her transformation into Sherlock Holmes daringly chasing down clues. He, on the other hand is suspiciously bland and characterless; he has been stripped of his personality to such a degree that he is merely a placeholder for 'handsome brooding aristocrat.' Do we even care what happens to either of them? Not much. The complexity of the original story has been replaced with a single note in a minor key; it is repeated in every chord, louder and louder to attempt to build to a climax. I understand that the writers and director were trying to adapt this story for a contemporary audience which is desensitized to subtlety by highly sensational, violent, and epic tales, but they have twisted this story into something unrecognizable to the author and her fans. I gave it 6 stars instead of 5 because the settings are quite stunning.",Rebecca,2020-10-21,6,32017,2020
tt2235695,4,"There should be a rule, don't remake a great classic movie if you have nothing new or interesting to add to it. This looked like the Hallmark version of Hitchcock's classic film noir. Lilly James is overacting the shy, inexperienced character, she walks like Forrest Gump in some scenes, for example where she's following Rebecca's ghost at the party. She also pouts all the time. Armie Hammer has the intensity of a carrot, he's too vanilla for the role. His suits are horrible, badly tailored, the mustard suit in the beginning is an eye sore. Kristin Scott Thomas as Mrs Danvers is the only saving grace of this movie. And finally, the cinematography is bad. It's like somebody wanted to make a rom com and changed their mind in the last minute. Those happy, ultra saturated colors don't fit the mood of a dark gothic romance novel in the least.",Rebecca,2020-10-21,6,32017,2020

The lead actress in this film is someone I've always enjoyed watching so I was pleased when I heard she was cast in this as I thought she would be good in this role. Unfortunately, I'm disappointed with this adaptation. It completely lacks charm and suspense. The whole film feels rushed and lines are delivered with no emotion. I didn't care for any of the characters. They didn't feel anything like those from the book. I just don't understand how - with such great material to work from - filmmakers can still get it so wrong in this day and age with every resource at their fingertips. So disappointing for the viewers. Overall, this feels like a TV adaptation, not a movie. Instantly forgettable.",Rebecca,2020-10-21,6,32017,2020
tt2235695,7,"This movie is not a 'remake' of the 1940 Hitchcock version. It is a book adaptation, which is what I think people tend to forget. I have read the book and seen the earlier film version and I think others are being a bit overdramatic with comparisons. It is fine to prefer the Hitchcock version but I think this movie did a good job. It was enjoyable, acted well, and beautifully shot. I was expecting this to be a fun, light hearted romance based off other's comments and was pleasantly surprised. It did have a Great Gatsby feel at first when they were in Monte Carlo but that quickly changes once they get to Manderley and the difference is stark. The psychological aspect was definitely there and I found myself very anxious watching the narrator deal with the 'ghost' of Rebecca. Lily James did well portraying the main character as insecure and paranoid, and much of it was communicated through her body language. I felt her emotions right along with her. My biggest disappointment was the lack of relationship development with Max, and I also think they could have cast someone older because the large age difference isn't present here. Overall, I enjoyed this film. It could have went a bit longer, and I was fine with the ending. I actually prefer the ending over the Hitchcock version where Rebecca died accidentally instead of actually being murdered by her husband. To me that totally changes the whole narrative and I'm glad they kept true to the book there. It's a heavier story and I appreciated the upbeat final scene. Definitely a movie to watch and form your own opinions on. If you enjoy gothic romances, give this a chance.",Rebecca,2020-10-21,6,32017,2020
tt2235695,9,"I'm not sure I understand the negativity...I adore the Hitchcock version, while the newer BBC version with Emilia Fox and Charles Dance always felt very miscast and the 1970's BBC version was just blah. But this 2020 remake was a happy surprise. I thought the casting was excellent and it has a modernity that I think many will appreciate, maybe even motivating them to read the source material. While it may not have the sleek polish of a 1940's movie with the unparalleled Laurence Olivier, this is a very worthy attempt.For those who criticize the Lily James character of the ""new Mrs. DeWinter,"" she is supposed to be ""jumpy"" and unsure of herself. That is the character. Armie Hammer brought a posh sophistication that also impressed me, since he was the casting choice I questioned the most, and Kristin Scott Thomas was delightfully creepy.It's been years since I read the book, but I'm downloading it soon to reread. And even if the movie is not 100% faithful to the book, it's certainly faithful enough at its core. Even the Hitchcock movie had changes.Whether you read the book or not, this version is worth your time. Great for a girl's night once the pandemic ends!",Rebecca,2020-10-21,6,32017,2020
tt2235695,2,"This was a travesty of a film. Compared to either the novel or Hitchcock's masterpiece this is crass and cliched, with unsubtle and implausible characterisation. The girl (never named ) was over-played by Lily James; rather than a woman driven to the edge of nervous breakdown, here she appeared on the edge of madness at times. Max was written and played by Hammer as weak and rather petulant - none of the imperiousness of his class. Add to this predictable dream sequences, an unnecessary near-car crash and an absolutely appalling last sequence which changes the whole tone of the book, turning the protagonists into abject failures, and you have a disaster. All of these faults have to be laid at the feet of poor writing and poor direction. A lavish production, wasted.Only Kirsten Scott Thomas was excellent and worth the two stars on her own.",Rebecca,2020-10-21,6,32017,2020
tt2235695,3,"What bothered me most about this adaptation was its handling of Maxim and the second Mrs. de Winter's relationship. Throughout most of the book, Maxim is reserved and standoffish toward the second Mrs. de Winter. Although he could be witty and playful, there was always a solid barrier between them. That's what made the scene where Maxim finally confesses what happened to Rebecca so potent. Finally, they (Maxim and the second Mrs de Winter) are able to be intimate because Maxim has let down his barrier.
In this movie, they are all over each other from the outset. There are a few moments of emotional distance between them, but the constant physical contact between them took away from the tension, loneliness and doubt that was so apparent in the book. And the ending - don't even get me started! That was so, so cheesy. Ugh!",Rebecca,2020-10-21,6,32017,2020
tt2235695,5,"With no knowledge of the original novel or the Hitchcock adaptation, I had a sense of intrigue in the build up to watching Rebecca. Sadly, for all the impressiveness of the costumes and locations, the current 5.8 rating is about right. I found myself watching and waiting for something to happen, rather than actually being engrossed in the story. It is rather dull and fragmented, with little suspense and characters you come to care little about. There seems to be little or no repercussions for anyone's actions, and the ending is rushed and cut to pieces. It felt like there was more story to tell but even two hours wasn't enough to fit it all in. Maybe a TV adaptation would have been a better idea....",Rebecca,2020-10-21,6,32017,2020

The acting is subpar, the few changes just takes away from the story, the costumes made you cringe at times, there was no mystery, no suspense, no foreboding atmosphere, no thrill and not even the Danvers character could add anything redeeming to this. There was nothing in this version that made the original such a timeless classic. At least in others adaptions, there was something of worth, even if it could not live up to its predecessor. You might want to stick to the original and forget this ever was made.",Rebecca,2020-10-21,6,32017,2020
tt2235695,3,"There's a lot to be said for keeping your expectations low, but Rebecca (2020) was a bit of a mess. I'm sure there will be edits and gifs galore because the house(s) used for Manderley - including my favourite Loseley Park - and the 30s-ish costumes are very pretty, however that doesn't stop this being yet another style over substance adaptation. And I'm judging this on Daphne Du Maurier's novel, not the 1940 film version.Let's see. The narrator's lack of confidence does not sit well on Lily James and that aspect of the character has almost been done away with anyway, to give her agency. She isn't baffled as to why Maxim wants to marry her because he's already shagged her on the beach, so 'I'm asking you to marry me, you little idiot' is made somewhat redundant (he'd better be!) And Lily's character also has more clothes than even Maxim, with his hideous suits, so Mrs D and Bea can hardly accuse her of being mousey and downtrodden. Armie Hammer is a plodding Maxim who seems bizarrely in love with his wife from the get-go, carrying her over the threshold and snogging her in front of the staff. A weirdly garish Mrs Van Hopper can run rings around him in Monte, so watching Maxim later take a back seat and wait for his wife to spring him from jail is hardly surprising. Everyone is raving over Kristin Scott Thomas as Mrs Danvers, and I suppose she is a highlight, but her character is more of a Margaret Thatcher clone than the disturbed housekeeper of the story. When she asks, 'Does he brush your hair?' she sounds like she's taking a survey. And don't get me started on how Jack Favell is presented as sympathetic swain - he bizarrely takes Rebecca's replacement for a riding lesson, after dashing to the stables to intone 'Rebecca was the only one who could tame you' to a wild horse. Okaaay.The plot can't decide between sepia-tinted romance and horror film - between the sleepwalking, a secret door to Rebecca's morning room, Lily slicing her hand open on the broken cupid, and Rebecca's body being hauled past the whole town in a tarp, I thought I was watching yet another haunted house series. There's also a healthy dash of Downton Abbey, with the new Mrs DW traipsing down to the servant's kitchen every five minutes, including a confrontation with Mrs Danvers (or 'Danvers!' as Maxim calls her) over Jack Favell, because reminding the viewers that servants are people too is very woke. And the final scenes are a complete disaster - the inquest and Rebecca's note to Favell are hopelessly muddled so that Maxim is thrown in jail and Lily's character has to find the name of Rebecca's doctor and STEAL HER MEDICAL FILE to set him free. I don't even know what that scene achieved, apart from showing sisters doing it for themselves.The real test is Maxim's confession, which was diluted by the Hays Code in the 1940 film, but this version is still weak. Instead of goading Maxim into a fury, Rebecca hands him a gun and tells him to shoot her. So he does. (He loads the same gun, presumably, while telling his new wife how he killed the last one and gives her the same option of killing him.) Lily's chirpy final narration - 'But this morning I woke up and left the dead behind!' - also sort of kills the moody vibes of the novel. We know the De Winters are living abroad when she dreams of Manderley, but are they happy? Between the misplaced feminist notes - Caroline De Winter of the portrait, now in a red dress, was 'one of the first women to qualify as a doctor', apparently - and stylish scenery like Rebecca's art deco hall of mirrors boudoir, this new take quite literally glosses over the original novel, with a bizarre soundtrack that includes both 'Pennies from Heaven' and 1970s folk band Pentangle. But at least I didn't pay £8.99 to be disappointed at the cinema this time!",Rebecca,2020-10-21,6,32017,2020
tt2235695,6,"I had such high hopes for this, anticipation was high, especially as new material has been somewhat thin on the ground this year, for obvious reasons.I did raise an eyebrow when I heard that Armie Hammer had been cast as Maxim, but I felt he did a decent job, it gives me hope for his upcoming part in Death on the Nile.The standout for me was Kristin Scott Thomas, she was a fearsome Mrs Danvers, very impressive.The film itself, very stylish, and had some good moments. If I'm totally honest, I was a tad disappointed, I think the pacing was a bit off, it perhaps felt a bit rushed at the ending.A few reviewers calling for no remakes, and yes the 1940 adaptation is the ultimate, but come on, many of us love seeing a retelling. However, if you haven't seen the adaptation with Olivier and Fontaine, I urge you to, it captures the atmosphere beautifully.Overall, it's a good watch, maybe it's the sinister atmosphere that's perhaps lacking. 6/10.",Rebecca,2020-10-21,6,32017,2020
tt2235695,3,"I was looking forward to this production as a fan of the book and the Hitchcock film and was wondering what a new version would add to it. The answer is - nothing, apart from a bit of sex on the beach ( not the cocktail). The two leads were totally uncharismatic. I am not familiar with Armie Hammer as an actor, he gave a creditable performance and looked handsome. Unfortunately, it wasn't of Maxim De Winter. There was no class, he was much too gentle and friendly and when he admitted how much he hated Rebecca, he just came over as a wimp. Lily James played the part of the un-named second wife as a school girl, why on earth would Maxim be interested in her. There was no gothic tension, Manderley appeared to be a large open library, as everyone trecked through a large tiled hallway that went on for ages. There was some beautiful photography of the South of France, but the restaurant refusing to serve the paid companion because she wasn't a guest was nonsense. She had a room at the hotel. After the first hour, I began to be bored and lost interest, but felt duty bound to stick with it to the end.
I liked the performance of the cad by Sam Riley and it took me ages to work out where I had seen him before and then remembered it was the TV mini series SS-GB. However, in that he had a deep gravelly voice, damaged it was said at the time for singing Heavy Metal. Now he has morphed into SImon Williams.
Everything dragged on and then was wound up quickly - a case of they think it's all over, it is now. If she was alive, Daphne Du Maurier must wonder where she went wrong.",Rebecca,2020-10-21,6,32017,2020
tt2235695,2,"I have to acknowledge that I absolutely love both the novel by Daphne du Maurier on which this movie is based and the original film adaptation by Alfred Hitchcock. So I already had misgivings upon finding out that a remake was going to be made... and starring no other than Lily James and Armie Hammer! To me, that was no incentive to watch the new version. That being said, I decided to give it an opportunity. But to no avail.First of all, like I just said, I find that Armie Hammer and Lily James are completely miscast as Mr. and Mrs. de Winter. I don't really like Lily James as I find most of her performances (e.g. in ""War and Peace"", ""The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society"" or ""Cinderella"") rather insipid. Still, I think that she can do a good job if given some specific kind of characters, like Lady Rose in ""Downton Abbey"". As for Armie Hammer, he is not one of my favorite actors either, but the problem for me remains the same: he just does not fit into this role! His looks, age and acting style just make him unsuitable. Of course, it would be really difficult to find two actors who would equal Joan Fontaine's and Laurence Olivier's performances, but I think the casting team was simply looking for two popular young actors. Hence the miscasting and the lack of chemistry between them. However, I must concede that Kristin Scott Thomas was a good choice for Mrs. Danvers. I wouldn't have thought of Sam Riley as Jack Favell, but he is not bad either.However, the cast is only one of the many issues with this film. Almost everything, from photography and special effects to music or costumes (Mrs. de Winter wearing trousers? Come on!), seemed so absurd and out of place to me - to say nothing about the film pace (at some points, especially at the beginning, I felt like I was watching a trailer rather than an actual movie) and simply the way the story is told, its tone and aesthetic. Starting with the scenes at Montecarlo where Mrs. Van Hopper hysterically makes fun of the protagonist because of the way she behaves with Maxim and that sex scene at the beach (really... WTF? It felt like a perfume commercial), followed by Maxim's sleepwalking, the Manderley ball, that melodramatic murder trial and everything else... Many important details of the story were poorly explained, and I could not help but laugh at the way some of the original movie's capital scenes (Mrs. Danvers encouraging Mrs. de Winter to commit suicide, Mrs. de Winter showing her frock for the ball...) were copied.To conclude: I am a millennial who loves both classic and contemporary cinema. I am not particularly conservative in my taste and I always feel curious about remakes. And still, this is not worth watching. 2/10.",Rebecca,2020-10-21,6,32017,2020
tt2235695,1,"What is the reason for making a new adaptation of a literary work? That is the question every filmmaker must ask himself before facing this task. Apparently, the director and scriptwriter of this new version of ""Rebecca"" never asked themselves; or if they did, they found answers to that question they could not transcribe in images and on the film itself.
If it was just showing scenes in the south of France on screen: welcome; serves as a tourist reference. But by trying to approach the book with ""more fidelity"" than Hitchcock did, they managed to get even further away from the Daphne du Maurier story.
""Rebecca"" is a gothic novel, something that the makers of this version seem to be unaware of; or maybe they don't know the meaning of ""gothic"" or how it is translated into a movie.
The answer is simple: see the 1940 film by Hitchcock, which, even affected by the implacability of the Hay's code, not only manages to reflect the essence of the novela, but also transcends as a classic, a masterpiece of cinema.
This mess is just that: a mess. A subset of mediocre performances coupled with poor production (it is not known why, because this film obviously had a much larger budget than Hitch had). And the two main characters are a disaster. Lily James (not a bad actress, let me clarify) all the time overacts her role as a shy and insecure creature, to the point that it becomes very annoying. Armie Hammer is pure vanilla, without a trace of guilt, problems and insecurities; a pretty face to wander around the screen from time to time and attract sighing damsels. Mrs Danvers is stripped of all the sexual ambiguity that the novel, and the 1940 film, subtly suggest. Honestly, the performance of Scott Thomas is the only reason anybody could claim for watching this film, and even her is limited excessively by the script.
The ending of the film is really so out of character and far from the novel that it is, in itself, tragic. The reality is that this film is neither a romantic comedy, nor a mystery film, much less Gothic at all, as it is the novel on which it is based. So, what is it? Well, you don't know: it wants to be everything (perhaps to appeal to a larger audience), but it is nothing. Rather, something is: a disaster.",Rebecca,2020-10-21,6,32017,2020

The fact that people hated her character means that one should really congratulate LJ for her successful portrayal of Mrs de Winter, which I think is loyal to the book. Although I wish some of the scenes where longer to allow LJ to really act out the emotions.I thought the Manderley set is marvellous, though some important points are missing, like the rhododendrons imagery or flowers in the valley. Also agree with some of the other reviews that suspense was lacking and it does feel rushed. But overall I liked the film and makes me want to read the book again.",Rebecca,2020-10-21,6,32017,2020
tt2235695,3,"Why, oh why are great masterpieces remade? This one is a dismal failure!After having read the wonderful novel and viewed Hitchcock's extraordinary film version repeatedly, (it remains one of my top ten favorite films) I must dismiss this this as a dismal failure.Some observations and impressions: Many lines are delivered in a strange manner, throwing off the meaning they should convey. Mrs Van Hopper is played as a gross, cliched caricature of the nouveau riche American visiting ""The Continent."" Lily James's awkward, loud performance lacks Joan Fontaine's lovely shy, reticence and femininity as the second Mrs. deWinter. Her hairstyle and wardrobe are inaccurate for the time period and she's rather unkempt looking for a time period where every hair was expected to be in place; lipstick and jewelry always worn. If she had been shown in a pair of trousers once, I would accept it, but wearing them repeatedly-and bell bottoms?
Nope! And wrong era!Armie Hammer is quite handsome, but he's no Maxim de Winter! His performance lacks the somber, dignity and self-possessed aura of privilege necessary to appear as an aristocratic gentleman. Kristin Scott Thomas's delivery of lines is plainly awkward, yet Keeley Hawes plays Beatrice Lacey well, as she excels in the society lady role.I miss the heavy air of romantic melancholia in Hitchcock's Manderley (and he achieved that on a limited Hollywood sound stage). This version is like a terrible TV movie. Sadly, the new ""Rebecca"" is beyond disappointing and I do not recommend it.",Rebecca,2020-10-21,6,32017,2020
tt2235695,5,"I am an enormous fan of the novel, having first read it about fifty years ago, and re-read it numerous times over the years. I never expect a movie to be exactly like the book--- I don't think it's possible most of the time---I just want the move to capture the spirit and essence of the book.I really the first 90 minutes or so of the movie, and then, CLUNK. The climax and denouement inexplicably veered from the spirit and essence of the novel. The weird party/dream scenes, the graphics of a dead body---both in and out of the water---, and the biggest unforced error during the scene when Maxim loads a gun and goads his wife to shoot him. In the novel, their love is cemented in that scene of confession, and it is super important to believe that they have re-discovered each other, which is not communicated in this movie. Also, the scene where she sneaks into the doctor's office, and in general, the way that they wove Favell into the plot, were enormous fails.It's not a bad way to spend two hours. As mentioned, I enjoyed the first three quarters of it and the cinematography is gorgeous.

tt2235695,3,"For an hour and 20 minutes this was so far, so Rebecca, without ever really adding anything to one of the greatest of gothic novels, or to the preceding cinematic adaptations. And then the wheels fell off.It turned into a whodunit (and, indeed, a who-dun-what), with skulking, dodging and amateur detectiving (completely pointless, because the police were on the very verge of discovering the truth anyway); no stone left unturned; every haunting mystery explained (even how Manderley burned, and what subsequently happened to Mrs. D); and as for the final scene: pure, unadulterated Netflix schmaltz making a total mockery of probably the most melancholy opening line in English literature: ""Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again"".Just writing that line tells me I must read the novel again so as to erase the bad taste left by this travesty of an adaptation.",Rebecca,2020-10-21,6,32017,2020

The filmmaking was above that for me. It just had that little bit of extra care put into it and i think it made all the difference.The acting was really great from both of the leads. I was really impressed with Kiera Allen. This was her debut film and i think this will net her even more roles because she was fantastic.I found the score really great too.

tt8633478,8,"In this simple, but fun plot, director Aneesh Chaganty maintains a tight narrative, executes some brilliant editing, and draws out from his two female leads nail-biting performances that make this thriller well worth a watch.OBLIGATORY PLOT RECAP: Chloe is a highly-intelligent, capable 17-year-old girl with a slew of physical disabilities and ailments. Regardless, she is looking forward to shrugging off her small-town life and heading to college, that is, if she can escape the control of her manipulative mother whose dark secrets run deeper than Chloe fears.Sarah Paulson has practically made a career out of playing insane characters who simmer behind her eyes, leaving you a bit frightened about when she's going to lash out. And, as usual, Paulson delivers her performance in spades. Watching her character struggle to maintain control when her world begins to crumble is terrifying because you know that whatever bad she's done still isn't the worst she can do.Kiera Allen, who plays the wheelchair-bound Chloe--and who is disabled in real life--makes her feature film debut in ""Run,"" and holds her own against Paulson's veteran-level acting chops. Allen makes you feel every bit of suffering Chloe goes through. She never stops for a second to lament her circumstances, but forges ahead as all good proactive heroines should!It's a shame watching the media parade around ""strong female characters"" like Captain Marvel, Rey Palpatine, and Mulan who are nothing more than Mary Sues in their own stories, when brilliantly written female characters like Chloe are struggling to be noticed. This movie made me think of 2019's ""Crawl,"" starring Kaya Scodelario, who played another wonderfully-written female character whose courage, wit, and proactive approach to conflict was character-driven and not magically bestowed upon them because the plot demanded it.I feel like some critics are being unfairly harsh on this movie. David Fear over at Rolling Stone called it a two-star ""misstep,"" while Jeannette Catsoulis at The New York Times insinuated that it's a bad thing that the movie doesn't rely on flashbacks. Are you kidding me?! My screenwriting professor taught me that flashbacks are the laziest form of storytelling and I agree. They're a cheap way to fill in the blanks, and ""Run"" is far more clever than that in how it unfolds its backstory.""Run"" is a very simple story and will feel predictable to many, but it's got a few nice twists and turns that will still keep you guessing. The performances of the leads are what will grip you the most, especially Allen's-who knew that watching a character try to write a single word with a crayon would make me cheer for them? You can do it, Chloe!",Run,2020-11-20,6.7,30460,2020
tt8633478,7,"So as many reviews have stated, there was a certain amount of predictability to the film. I will call BS on people 'knowing everything that would happen' - I doubt they knew it would end how it does.The complaints I saw in the reviews are mostly people unwilling to embrace the suspension of disbelief, and I think that is their loss. Of course there are things in here that are farfetched and inaccurate... short of BBC films, you will find that in pretty much every movie. Just because you happen to understand the medical jargon going on in this one doesn't make it less believable than the film you had no 'real world' knowledge on. I think this is a pet peeve of mine.Common complaints again, talking about how a woman could kidnap a child and make her sick, and nobody would notice. WHHHHHHHHHHHHAT? It's like you folks have never heard of munchausen by proxy. It happens a bit more than you'd like to think. They specifically address how this goes under the radar by her use of veterinarians, the fact that she has changed her primary doctor 12 times in a short period of time, home schooling, etc. Are there holes in the plot here? Yes. But they do try to fill in most of the gaps.Another complaint is why the daughter doesn't really do anything to stop her mother. Sharp objects around, etc. But this is, until a week ago, a mother who she believed loved and took care of her. Stockholm syndrome can kick in as a teenager, after a shorter period of time (i.e. Elizabeth Smart who might have been rescued months before had she been able to speak up). Children who are abused frequently can't retaliate. This aspect is not at all far fetched.Like I said, there were parts of the story that were predictable. You knew from the previews that mom was making her sick. Not far in, after seeing how isolated she made them (and the fact that it was clear she wasn't going to let her daughter leave the house), you assumed something else had transpired (ie the kidnapping). The part at the end where she is slipping mom the pills - I did not see that coming.To the acting, Sarah Paulson was great. She did a great job with the subtle creepiness. When the daughter is looking things up online that first night, they do focus in on Sarah after she gives up (sitting in the kitchen watching her try to google things)... but it would be a lot easier to miss her already sitting there when the daughter comes down the stairs.I think the actress who plays the daughter is still coming into her own, and I definitely don't think this is the best genre for her, but she wasn't bad.While predictable - I enjoyed the movie. It is a more subtle, creepy film. I also think they have a lot of nuanced stuff going on with accessibility that went over a lot of reviewers heads (like where mom's escape is only thwarted because the wing is not accessible).I will say, the part where she ninjas out her window, into her mom's room, back to her room (for the inhaler), was just a little ridiculous. :)",Run,2020-11-20,6.7,30460,2020

tt1086064,3,"So first off. It was very very predictable from the start that the two daughters would end up ""saving the day"".The daughters are super cringe worthy. Bill and Ted were a comedic surfer dude stereotype. The girls take it a step further. They don't just take some mannerisms from their dads they are like a satirical sketch of their dads and it was hard to watch. They could have just been normal or said ""dude/most excellent"" etc without the whole weird body poses etc.On top of that remember bill and Ted used to wear stuff that wasn't that strange or out there for their time periods. They wear super 80s stuff in the 80s and super 90s stuff in the 90s and now they again wear very period appropriate regular clothing. The daughters on the other hand wear these super strange outfits. Esp the short black haired girl was wearing this incredibly weird tight top thing that just looked so stupid and out there.Anyway. So I'm no ""man's rights activist"". In fact o hate those people..but MAN did they try hard to basically remove bill and Ted from the movie and make it as female centric as possible. Before you dislike, hear me out.1. Bill and Ted the leads of the movies are shown as utter failures and versions of then are even worse. Alcoholic, liars, thieves and inmates etc. Even their best versions suck, can't make any good music etc2. They have two daughters who from the start look like they are being set up to take the franchise over. It really looks like the writers / creators would preferably just not use Bill and Ted at all and continue the story with their daughters3. Great ones are now all female.4. Rufus is dead and his daughter now continues his work while his wife has become the great one.5. Ling Lun is a female in the movie (supposed to be male)6. Greatest drummer ever? A black cave woman who makes monkey sounds.*Not only did they turn Ling Lun into a female, which is culturally insensitive. They made a black woman into an ape like cave woman that jumps around like an animal and makes weird faces and monkey noises. How is that acceptable?7. Daughters unlike their dads (who have always been shown as rather daft) are geniuses who understand quantum physics and can write the most brilliant song ever without knowing how to play any instruments etc.*I legit thought the rapper was made up / fake but apparently kid cudi is a real person. And accordihg to the movie he understands quantum physics. WHY? I googled him.hoping he'd have some degree in real life that would justify it, but no. The first thing that came up is that this guy called Jaden Smith ""the chosen one"". I'm sorry but no one with anything over 1/5th of a regular human brain would say that unironically. Why not have an actual intellegent / genius black dude in the movie? It's not like they don't exist and there are far smarter (and better) rappers too. Also, the rapper is station? What? At least it would explain why he is so smart but then again they are using a real life rapper.8. The (male) robot is also an incredible failure. So is Ted's dad9. It's the daughters that manage to convince Death to join the band while B&T fail.
10. The daughters are the ones that write the song and save the universe in the end. Bill and Ted are ""there for them"" and ""part of their band"".That doesn't make any sense! And I'm not looking for too much logic in a movie like this, but this is the dumbest (and most predictable) plot twist I've ever seen. If that's the case why does the future worship B&T? Why do they listen to B&Ts music and talk about their song etc? Why not a single reference to their daughters?Also the song SUCKED like it was so bad. It wasn't even really rock even though we heard rock in the future (previous movies). And everyone is supposed to play an instrument. You'd think the song would sound like a giant orchestra but it sounds like some computer generated electronic song with some electric guitar mixed in.
To whoever makes these movies. It's OK to make a movie about two (white) dudes. You don't have to shoehorn in female cast members etc or try to turn every movie about a bunch of dudes into a movie about a bunch of dudettes. I'm sure many if not most women also don't care about shoehorned in women. Instead of ruining movies that happen to have male leads with efforts to shoehorn in women, write a good movie with women leads.
As a minority I see what Hollywood is doing as well intentioned but it's so damn stupid. Like the virus song that gal gaddot did etc. STOP. Just make good movies. Stop with the forced characters and gender,ethnicity changes etc. Instead make good newmovies about women and minorities etc",Bill & Ted Face the Music,2020-08-28,6.1,30218,2020

Where was the metal and rock influence? It was gone... Who the hell is Kid Kudi and why was he even in the last song? What did he do?The actors playing the daughters are both really good in other projects i've seen them on, but in this they felt like carbon copies of Bill and Ted from the originals and again... it didn't work.This movie gave me serious Ghostbuster Reboot vibes and that is the worst thing I could possibly say about any movie ever.As far as I'm concerned, Bill and Ted ended perfectly in Bogus Journey, and yeah the Reaper really did win the Indy 500 - who knew he could run so fast?",Bill & Ted Face the Music,2020-08-28,6.1,30218,2020

I didn't enjoy this. It messed with the history and wasn't even funny.
Rufus clearly states that Wylde Stallyns' music saves the world, not a specific song and Elizabeth and Joanna are members of the band. Death is the only member to even play the song. Changing the mythology to Preston/Logan is not what Rufus said.
I'm a feminist, but I hate the current trend of crowbarring in female characters. Little Bill and Little Ted were obviously boys. If they really wanted girls in this, they could have had more children.
The Princesses were too young and, if memory serves, they're meant to be the same age, not two years apart.
The plot was predictable, except for Dennis in hell, which wasn't explained.
Waiting decades for a sequel is always a gamble, but this was worse than Episode One and Crystal Skull.
I don't want to turn this into a total rant;
I was mildly amused by Missy re-marrying and by the future Bills and Teds, but I don't think I'll watch it again. Despite still collecting DVDs and having a touch of OCD, when it comes to completing sagas, I won't be buying this.

This film was never going to top the first two, becasue they are a product of their time, and you can never re-create that, but Bill & Ted Face The Music is a decent enough send off for the characters.It is a bit sad though that it is just ""ok"". The film does have a certain cheapness to its look and feel, and Keanu was sounding a bit tired if I'm honest. It retreads some ground, but not as much as you would think, and there are genuine laughs in here for sure. Dean Parisot's directing is solid, but a bit lacklustre in places, and I think they should have got Peter Hewitt back from Bogus Journey. It's not awful by any means, but I think it lacks a bit of magic (which was probably the 80s/90s).A special mention must go to Alex Winter who does a great job here. He IS Bill S. Preston, and he has his old mannerisms down to a tee which was very familiar and very comforting.In a way, the film made me a bit sad. Bogus Journey tied up the story quite well, but there was always a bit of the door open to do more if they wanted, and now that it's done it was a kind of uneventful. 1994-ish would have been a perfect time to do a third film, because as upsetting as it is, Bill and Ted with all their ""Wows"" and ""Dudes"", are The past.However, they are MY past, and from MY generation, so I was very happy to see them once last time, and despite all the nitpciks, I had fun with the film.All that's left to say is the best message in any film ever:Be excellent to each other...... and party on!!!",Bill & Ted Face the Music,2020-08-28,6.1,30218,2020

And there was a sweetness in watching Bill&Ted again fumble their way to saving the world/universe/reality.But the problems with B&T are the usual problems with most remarks and sequels coming out of Hollywood.* I'm definitely for equality, but the males (with backstory) in the film are either dysfunctional or complete idiots while the women come to save the day because they're portrayed as smarter and more resourceful. Spread the cluelessness around, and spread the resourcefulness around.* (Future) Bill&Ted were even painted as being manipulative and nasty in some parts, which is not who they were in the original films.* the daughters bring everyone together in the end and are credited with creating THE SONG. But neither plays an instrument and just offer some feedback on what each musician was attempting to do. So they don't really have any talent other than telling seasoned and talented musicians what to do (cause the daughters listened to lots of music and therefore know better then them I suppose). If they are to be the heroes then they really should have had stronger parts written for them.
Hollywood, if you're going for strong female leads in a film then give the female lead a backstory, with skills that justify them being in that role. No-one deserves a leading role just because they fit a particular demographic.* the music. What can I say other than there was soooo much more they could have done with this. The music in B&T was build around the time period they were in. Metal & rock were cool at the time so the original films can be placed in a time period. This one however... it's almost like they didn't have a clear idea of what they wanted to portray.* I have to say I like Bill's daughter and how she tried to go full Bill/Keanu. She nailed a lot of his idiosyncratic movements and facial expression. Ted's daughter though could have been played by anyone. So this missed the beat for me. Either make sure the daughters are girl versions of the Dads, give them their own personalities&mannerisms, or even swap them (Ted's daughter behaves like Bill and vice versa). Unfortunately we got half of one of these.There are more, but other reviewers have covered these points.Finally, I just want to say that it's sad that the film missed the point of Bill&Ted - it was never about saving the world, or their marriages. They were just 2 sweet dudes, a little clueless, trying to do what they thought was right in their own way. And we like seeing their positivity come through even when times were rough. And because they were always positive things worked out in the end, sometimes with a little help from Rufus.There was a glimmer of that here, but not enough.",Bill & Ted Face the Music,2020-08-28,6.1,30218,2020
tt1086064,3,I really enjoyed the first two movies but this one was very boring. It lacked of the former edge of the series; it was way too sanitized and politically correct. The result is a soulless Bill and Ted with no charm and fun.,Bill & Ted Face the Music,2020-08-28,6.1,30218,2020

tt1086064,3,"This is a movie that didn't need to be made.While the opening scene was amusing, the rest of the movie was little more than a mashup of the first two movies. As a story it adds very little to the mythos and storyline of Bill and Ted, and quite frankly had more to do with their daughters (which is really no surprise).Brigette Lundy-Paine actually did a remarkable job emulating the mannerisms of Keanu Reeves 25 years ago, but there just was no real chemistry between her and Samara Weaving, The ending of the film was basically just a rehashing of the ending of the second film where they did the thing and all the world unites (again) in harmony and song, with a maguffin device straight out of Doctor Who.With the original(s) there was at least a sense of growth and maturation with Bill and Ted, overcoming an obstacle. In this, things happened, and then more things happened, and no one was really better or worse for it -- things just happened. Sadly, Hollywood is just bent on regurgitating everything that was delightful and fun 20 years ago, and is dragging everything kicking and screaming into the present. Many were saying this, myself included, that Bill and Ted, like Wayne and Garth, Jay and Silent Bob, Randal and Dante, Han and Chewie, exist in a time that is no longer, and there is no real place for them as they were back then today -- let them stay in the past, so we can build on the legacy for tomorrow.Movies like Bill and Ted are locked in time, and today it just doesn't translate well. There was something interesting about Socrates, Billy the Kid, Abraham Lincoln, Joan of Arc, Sigmund Freud, and Beethoven that fit the narrative well: What would these historical figures think of San Dimas California in the then present time?In this you just have an assortment of random, name dropped historical figures, Mozart, Hendrix, Louie Armstrong, some cave man on drums, Kid Cudi and a Chinese Flute Player, all who are just there for no real rhyme or reason, more so because they came up on an algorithm generated by Spotify or Apple Music based on ""your personal likes"".For the most part, I found the story and the film to be lacking in any real substance (and this is comparing it to the not at all serious, light hearted BaT:EA and BaT:BJ), or point. It was just... there, and then it was done. It adds nothing new or interesting, and really doesn't have to be watched at all.

tt1086064,3,"Loved the originals, I didn't expect this to be good, and I'm so glad we didn't pay to see it because I would've been peeved. There are a couple of jokes in the beginning that were funny, but it fizzles out thereafter. There's no real plot here, the characters have no depth, it's not like they did in the original movies but there weren't so many of them thrown together in one film that it made it feel chaotic and disengaging. Mostly I felt like there wasn't any cohesion whatsoever, it felt as though the script was thrown together in a single night and rushed into production to satisfy fans. The biggest let down is the music, the music is awful. How do you have Dave Grohl cameo and not play? I just don't understand that. Instead we get Kid Cuddi pumping up the crowd (he doesn't sing, which I'm thankful for, but then why is he even there?). Part of what made the Bill and Ted franchise appealing to fans was that it occurred when metal was at it's height, instead of trying to appeal to those same fans, who probably still listen to metal, they instead tried to amalgamate every music genre in the world to appeal to everyone, and it comes off as just that, a hot mess of musical genres.

No, it wasn't. They did try to mimic the style of the past movies with a prime example being a robot called ""Dennis"" but it just ended up being cringy.Did it follow the plotline of the past movies?
Yes... up to a point. The main character are no longer the saviors of the world with the power of their musical capabilities. Instead they became as the movie states themselves ""losers with no job"" and not only that but in the end they revealed that they never even made the song or put the band together, their children did.Who were the saviors then?
Their daughters which the movie focused around for more then half of the film. The daughters character were fine and resembled how Bill & Ted are suppose to be portrayed but making them the saviors of the world instead of the Bill & Ted just spits in the face of the previous movies plotlines.I can no longer enjoy the past movies knowing that in their world our 'heroes' bill and ted become 'losers' and never end up saving the world.

tt1086064,1,"Biggest fault of this movie is taking the main characters and changing NOTHING about them. They're dads, they raised kids. They just wouldn't be the same guys they were 30 years ago. The daughters are exactly like them. That's just weird and it isn't funny. There was an opportunity for drama that just wasn't exploited, considering how much music tastes have changed since then.Rufus's replacement is also his daughter and she's absolutely brutal to watch. The actress is terrible, very millennial, just uninspired.Alex Winter is terrible to watch. He could pull off this act thirty years ago easily. Today, it doesn't work. You know it's the same guy, but it's like some movie where an alien takes over someone's body. The actor is uncomfortable playing the role. He doesn't get it anymore. It's hard to watch him struggle through it. Same kind of applies to Keanu. He really shows his age here, hard to believe he was 24 or 25 in the first movie and he was playing a teenager? Now he's 55 and still trying to act like one. How has he not changed, mentally?Most ridiculous is Hal Jordan, Keanu's dad, still working as a cop at almost 80 years old? The police scenes with him are just unbelievable. What was the point of this?The whole film was just a train wreck. By the time I decided to check the time and see if I could finish it, I realized I had an HOUR left to go. No way. I was done.

Which was surprising.William Sadler was amazing as Death, again. The scenes with the princesses also played very well.The daughters and all the new side characters didn't work. The robot might have worked if the rest of the film played better.I would have given this 1 star if it wasn't for Alex Winter. The future versions of Bill were golden.

tt10514222,8,I didn't really know much about this movie going in so i was surprised to find out that it was based on a play but after watching it you can see that fact from a mile off.The film is soaked in play-like monologues and limited sets and the framing. It works so well. It is such a dialogue heavy movie that it could run the risk of being a little bit slow but it is just that well acted and the dynamics and topics are so well thought out that you find time flying by while watching.The characters are really 3 dimensional and you understand who they are. This is all backed up by the acting. For the most part everyone in this movie hits it out of the park. i really love Colman Domingo and he really shines in this film. He just has a charm that draws you to any character that he plays. Chadwick was really great too. His emotional scenes really sweep the rug out from under your feet and i really wasn't expecting him to be able to do that he was really great. And Viola Davis is just fantastic. I love how she just dives head first into her characters and just lives in them. It reads so well on screen. She just embodies the role even down to the way she walks is just done to perfection.There isn't a whole lot of story because it is very character based but it does things to keep it fresh and i found it to be really shocking at times and took turns that you really wouldn't expect.The costumes are also really well done. I would guess that they would get an Oscar nod because they are fantastic.I would defiantly see this movie especially if you love character studies and want to feel like you looking though a window into a day in the life of these people.,Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,2020-12-18,7.1,29004,2020
tt10514222,6,"I thought it was very similar to Fences (2016), another August Wilson adaptation and unfortunately in both I found the dialogue very tedious. The performances in both are good, in this particularly Chadwick Boseman - he has he most to work with. I didn't find any part of the narrative compelling. I enjoyed the music, but so little of the runtime is spent actually playing music. Instead there's an awful lot of wordy bickering.

tt10514222,8,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Usually, at the end of each year, I prepare my watchlist for the next twelve months. Obviously, no matter how many movies I add to the list, I know dozens of more films will be announced and released throughout the year. Ma Rainey's Black Bottom is one of them. I didn't know a thing about this flick, but it received the always interesting awards buzz, which turned it into a mandatory viewing before Christmas comes around. I went in knowing only one thing: this is Chadwick Boseman's (Black Panther, Avengers: Infinity War) last appearance after he passed away a few months ago. I really didn't know what to expect from this Netflix's Oscar-bait, but I was afraid that Boseman's nomination chances were high only due to what happened in real-life instead of him truly deserving that recognition...Well, I can safely and confidently write that Boseman delivers his career-best interpretation, and it wouldn't be unfair for him to get tons of awards posthumously. From an impeccable accent to his mind-blowing emotional range, passing through long monologues and uncut takes effortlessly, Boseman is the strong glue that holds everything in place. What seems, at first, a hangout movie (narrative without a clear central plot) turns into a character-study. Levee wants to follow his dreams, do what he does best in his own conditions and with his personal interpretation of music and soul. Boseman incorporates this character seamlessly, delivering a memorable performance that I hope will be remembered as a worthy Oscar winner if this situation ends up becoming true.Even though Boseman is the actor that shines brighter, every single one is absolutely outstanding. Viola Davis shares the main spotlight with him by representing the (real-life) iconic blues singer, Ma Rainey. To be completely honest, I didn't know who this singer was nor how she impacted soul music. Ruben Santiago-Hudson first feature-film screenplay is packed with entertaining banter between the band members but also with heartfelt, gut-wrenching, shocking monologues that deeply explore a character's past and personality. Davis tackles every single line of hers with brutal intensity and extreme expressiveness, constantly offering 200% of her energy.George C. Wolfe (first movie I see of his) demonstrates exquisite control of every scene and elevates the dialogue-driven narrative with an exceptional balance of tone and pacing. Tobias A. Schliessler's camera lingers beautifully on the actors, allowing them to showcase their abilities but also helping the viewer feel enthralled with their words by not creating any unnecessary technical distractions. Andrew Mondshein's editing also contributes a lot to the smooth pace that the film warrants, but it's Branford Marsalis' inspiring, soulful score that will probably encourage most viewers to enjoy the overall movie. Technically, I can't point out a single issue. Huge praise for the appropriate costume design and overall production value.Honestly, I don't really have much to complain about. It might not have a conventional main plot, but it's also far from being a ""nothing"" film. As I mentioned above, the banter between Toledo (Glynn Turman), Cutler (Colman Domingo), Slow Drag (Michael Potts), and Levee is incredibly amusing and genuinely hilarious at times. However, it goes down through an unexpected dark path, ultimately culminating in a surprising finale. Every character has their own monologue containing details of their personal lives, which I regularly felt interested in, despite the repetitive structure. It works as a character-study, mainly about Levee and Ma Rainey, but also as a fun, good time that goes by quicker than I initially anticipated.In the end, Ma Rainey's Black Bottom is going to be forever remembered as Chadwick Boseman's last role. Call it destiny, but it's, undoubtedly, Boseman's career-best performance. Hopefully, if he ends up winning an Oscar posthumously, this won't be identified as a charity recognition but as a worthy, fair, triumphant celebration of his inspiring, impactful talent on-screen. Viola Davis also shines in this uncommon narrative, which focuses its spotlight on long, uncut, engaging monologues, captivating dialogues, and entertaining banter, all handled effortlessly by every actor involved. Despite the absence of a clear central plot, it's closer to a character-study than to a hangout flick. George C. Wolfe and Ruben Santiago-Hudson deliver a technically flawless movie with an excellent balance of its tone and pacing but also boasting impeccable cinematography, seamless editing, and a soulful score. It's definitely a serious contender for the awards season, so make sure to save ninety minutes of your Christmas season to enjoy this simple yet surprising story.Rating: A-",Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,2020-12-18,7.1,29004,2020

tt10514222,6,"A sweaty and monotonous film about (among other things) the white appropriation of black popular culture.""Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,"" like ""Fences"" from 2016, is a screen adaptation of an August Wilson play produced by Denzel Washington. Washington doesn't find a role for himself in this one, handing over the heavy lifting to Viola Davis and the late Chadwick Boseman. Like ""Fences,"" this film never breaks free of its stage artifice, and what I'm sure was powerful when performed live feels stilted and overly scripted when captured in intimate closeup. It's a whole lot of one thing, and I was amazed to see that its running time was a lean 94 minutes, because I would have bet money it cracked the two-hour mark.Davis gets a couple of opportunities to flex her acting chops, but it's Boseman who's getting all of the attention and will sure to be recognized come awards time. I have a feeling at least part of that will be due to the fact that he tragically died right around the time the film came out and sentiment for him will be strong. But it's also the kind of performance that awards groups like. It's big and loud and full of monologues, but it always felt to me like Boseman was trying too hard to ACT instead of naturally embodying a character.Grade: B",Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,2020-12-18,7.1,29004,2020
tt10514222,7,"This August Wilson adaptation is set in Chicago in 1927, and follows a blues singer, Ma Rainey (Viola Davis) who is recording music in Chicago at the time. The film focuses on the dynamics between her, a white manager, and several people that work with her during the recording session, such as a horn player (Chadwick Boseman.) The film's performances are excellent. Viola Davis shows a strong range of emotion and wit, and Chadwick Boseman's charisma and command of his role are superb. It is an almost incomprehensible tragedy that Boseman passed away suddenly this year, and this is (sadly) his final performance. Wilson's dialogue is handled very well in the film; while the film generally feels like a play, it is fully engaging and properly paced. The dialogue is able to appropriately develop the characters, while also honestly coming to terms with the racial tensions and systemic discrimination that sadly plagued society during this period in time. The film also has terrific aesthetic values of the time period, from production design to costumes to cinematography. These aesthetics are not negatively impacted at all by the fact that the film largely takes place in a handful of mostly confined spaces.While a relatively brief film in duration (94 minutes,) the film never feels too brief or unsatisfying. The pacing is deft yet thorough, appropriately contextualizing its characters and the situations they find themselves in--all while tying in to the blues music and the impact it has on the characters. Its conclusion is powerful and stirring, and appropriately feels like a fitting end to the narrative. The only major criticism I have of the film is that much of the film is relatively light on substantive plot, which does not always make the story as impactful as it could be. Even though the dialogue between characters is outstanding, some of the narrative could have used more ""meat and potatoes"" plot points to further evolve the course of the story. Otherwise, this is a powerful film that is well worth seeing. 7.5/10",Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,2020-12-18,7.1,29004,2020

The combative nature of the heroine, on the other side, is very instructive, and necessary in life - if one does not use one's leverage, a fate of the lamenting trumpeter is there, otherwise, good leveraging of your creative powers can be a tool so powerful, that even rac eist white men will have to respect black artist in the rac eist 20s Chicago.",Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,2020-12-18,7.1,29004,2020

It was a play and this just seems like they didn't do much to change it.
If you expecting the story of Ma Rainey you won't get it - more just a snap shot of one incident. The sound and voice when viola lip synced was not great and just didn't match. Maybe I had too high expectations because of the cast and director. There were so good moments and it's a snap shot of time and history that ultimately hasn't really moved on a lot.

tt10514222,1,I had never heard of Ma Rainey until I watched this movie. After watching I read some articles about the movie and Ma. Though I still know little about her it is my opinion that this movie does a great disservice to her. Ma was known as the Mother of Blues. She was one of the first recorded blues singers and sang with the likes of Louis Armstrong. None of this is included in the movie. No mention what so ever. The movie in fact is based on a play and the movie is pure fiction based on a real woman. I would have much preferred seeing a movie based more on the facts concerning Ma Rainey.,Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,2020-12-18,7.1,29004,2020
tt10514222,8,"First things first. Chadwick Boseman gives a performance like nothing you've ever seen. The rest of the cast, led by the legend that is Viola Davis, is, as might be expected, tip-top, but Mr Boseman flies ever higher in every scene.The film is based on a famous play by a great playwright who chose to write with a sense of melodrama that can still work in the theatre but somehow feels dated when transfered to the screen. The camera has to cope with the sheer size of performance necessary to capture set-piece speeches, which go against the grain of image-led cinema. Renowned Broadway director George C Wolfe gets the actors to the right temperature, but then has to find a way to make the project cinematic. The solutions here, apart from minimal opening out from the claustrophobia of the recording studio setting, are some mobile camera work and quite a bit of nimble editing. Curiously, though, these strategies simply emphasise the work's stage origins. What do work are the close-ups. They bring us closer to the characters than can ever happen on a stage. With an ensemble as fine as this one, the more close-ups the better.So, MA RAINEY'S BLACK BOTTOM, like the film of Wilson's play FENCES, is not satisfying as a movie, but as a record of a powerful play. Both well worth seeing. MA RAINEY is the greater, because of Chadwick Boseman. What an amazing actor. What a loss. What a legacy.",Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,2020-12-18,7.1,29004,2020
tt10514222,4,I was expecting so much... Disappointed as the excellent actors are driven into an endless banter with the late Mr. Boseman doing his best to steal the movie. Happily I had an excellent book on stand by. It went wrong and had everything to be great.,Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,2020-12-18,7.1,29004,2020
tt10514222,8,"""Ma Rainey's Black Bottom"" is certainly of interest as a biopic of the ""Mother of the Blues"" Ma Rainey (as played by Viola Davis) and for the last great screen performance from the late Chadwick Boseman as the fictional trumpeter Levee in Ma's band. Beyond this, it's partly hindered as an extension of the stage in the same way that Denzel Washington's adaptation of another of August Wilson's Pittsburg Cycle of plays, ""Fences"" (2016), was, but this adaptation by Ruben Santiago-Hudson and directed by Goerge C. Wolfe, although still including Washington as a producer, largely transcends its staginess by reflexively being about the process of adapting stage performance to recorded media, from musical concert to recording session--just as the movie is a recorded adaptation from live theatre. Unlike most filmed plays, its theatricality reflects its narrative.Moreover, it's set in 1927, which, whether or not the filmmakers intended the allusion, was also the year of the film ""The Jazz Singer,"" the heralded first feature-length synchronized sound film and film musical. Apt for a Netflix release about recording music, and, more than that, ""The Jazz Singer,"" among other things, is also about what today might be more-politely termed cultural appropriation, as evidenced most notoriously in the blackface sequence. That 1927 film is about the clashing and harmonizing of cultures in general, really: part silent and part talkie, Judaism and show business, the whiteness of the film's jazz singer and the origins of the music from black musicians as called attention to in the controversial blackface worn by Al Jolson. Point is, some of the same issues are brought up in ""Ma Rainey's Black Bottom.""Boseman's Levee wants to play his own, jazzier, more-swinging music as opposed to performing in Ma Rainey's ""jug band,"" while at the same time there's no denying the influence of her blues on the history of popular music, including collaborating with the likes of Louis Armstrong and Bessie Smith. Ma also retains her own voice, whereas ""Baby, Let Me Have It All"" (which with its ""jelly rolls"" makes me think of Jelly Roll Morton, in addition to how raunchy these old tunes about ""rolls"" and the titular ""bottom"" are, but I digress) is coopted by a white band and studio owner. Besides this, the characters take part in a series of theatrical monologues and dialogues on racial issues, religion and other matters, and there's Ma's reported homosexual relationships, one of which was rumored to be with Smith. Again, such a connection may've not been intended--indeed, such an artifact of Jewish identity and white culture would be out of place here in a sense--but the parallels are manifold and felicitous in the sense of cinematic heritage.Although its reflexivity, including a particular focus on the technical aspects of recording, are what raises this title above a mere filmed play, the costumes and production design also help, and there are a few different locales beyond the record studio to open the play up. Even the cinematography of the sweat on the figures' faces throughout the exhausting performances and hot-summer recording session recommends itself. The opening concert scene is a standout, and it, reportedly, includes the one bit of Davis doing her own singing. The rest said to be performed for by soul singer Maxayn Lewis. The same sources say Boseman actually learned to play the trumpet, although I would be surprised if his playing weren't also aided by modern sound-recording tricks. Regardless, Davis and Boseman headline a superb overall cast. Davis is especially imposing in looking the part of a legendary historical figure. And Boseman is surely the sentimental favorite for a posthumous Oscar this year, and his performance might just very well deserve it. There are a couple moments that are overly stagy--the more sudden outbursts of speechifying in particular, but even that may be followed by a helluva powerful monologue such as of Levee's story of his childhood. Overall, his performance transcends any fun-loving jazzcat stereotype in a similar vein to the picture overcoming its being a filmed play. The business with Levee's obsession with that ""trap"" door is a neat metaphor in both respects. He and his character become artists. It's a moving conclusion to a career tragically cut far too short. Yet, just as records immortalized the blues singing of Ma Rainey, or these adaptations have done for August Wilson's plays, motion pictures have done likewise for the artistry of Chadwick Boseman.",Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,2020-12-18,7.1,29004,2020

tt11024272,4,"I loved the first one and was ecstatic to see the sequel. Unfortunately, this movie lost nearly all the charm that made the first one so good; was riddled with plot holes; and most of all, suffered from a severe lack of Samara Weaving.LACK OF CHARM
The first film was filled with cute, gimmicky scenes (think video game style scenes). As a grown man in his late 20s, I would think it would be nearly impossible to be intrigued by a movie starring a little boy. But the charm made it happen. There was a slight sense of humor in many of the scenes and it kept the viewer interested.In this movie, however, nearly all charm was gone. Some scenes tried too hard to be charming, specifically the fight scene between the two love interests (boring). I also cringed at Phoebe's introduction scene as it felt overly forced. I can only imagine how awkward it was rehearsing that scene over and over. The entire movie was just too one-dimensional and didn't feel special like the first.PLOT HOLES
First off, the entire premise of the movie is that nobody believes Cole that the events of the first movie happened, since Bee did such a stupendous job cleaning up everything. Was everyone there ignoring the fact that Bee just disappeared? Did that not raise any flags? What about the fact that four other teenagers were gone as well as two cops? I could go on about this but it was immediately apparent that the viewer just had to accept this major flaw in order to get the sequel, I guess.Secondly, Mel going evil made no sense. Literally zero. I understand that it was supposed to be a dramatic twist, but come on. She says that she joined the cult because she ""wants to be an influencer."" Wow, how creative. We are soon after shown a scene where Bee is egging on Mel to want more and more followers, which suggests that Bee is the mastermind behind all of the cast's resurgences. Okay, that make sense. But later, it is revealed that Bee cleverly set all those people up in order to protect Cole and Phoebe. So, Bee turned Mel evil in order to save Cole and Phoebe from Mel? Makes no sense. The same applies for all the other evil characters. Bee was the instigator and also their undoing.SAMARA WEAVING
Okay, here it is. Nearly all of the reasons that the first movie was great was based on Samara Weaving playing Bee. She was this cool, slick, sexy in-charge chick. She made the first movie what it was. But in this one, she didn't really make an appearance until the final fifteen minutes and even then it was only a shell of her former self. She seemed emotionless, timid, and downright uncomfortable. It was incredibly disappointing to see such wasted potential. Perhaps most curious was how Bee was Mel's babysitter. On the one hand, it was neat how there was some explanation toward how Bee became the evil person she was, but it also felt like a giant cop out of a storyline.There are several other things wrong with this movie that I didn't get to, but the disappointment is currently overtaking me from writing anymore. Overall, there are so many other directions a sequel could have taken based on the first's ending. This movie was a C+ at best and I'd caution fans of the first to take heed when watching this, and perhaps avoid it altogether in order to maintain the integrity of the first movie.",The Babysitter: Killer Queen,2020-09-10,5.8,27713,2020

tt11024272,4,"I enjoyed The Babysitter, however, The Babysitter: Killer Queen had very little in common with the first film. The issues come down to Brian Duffield not being retained as the screenwriter. The team of McG (also Director of both films), Dan Lagana, Jimmy Warden, and Brad Morris cobbled together a film full of unrelated film references and teenage sex jokes.The Babysitter wasn't a masterpiece when it came to dialogue, yet in comparison to its sequel, it looks Oscar worthy. The Babysitter: Killer Queen doesn't have anything clever, wastes money on needless graphics, and fails to deliver on narratives in the original.It's shocking the script used for the film wasn't a rough draft for a potential plot sequence. The Babysitter: Killer Queen took the worst possible narrative and turned it into a barely coherent sequel.If you are going to produce a sequel, at least keep it true to the source material.

tt11024272,4,"A mostly pointless, forced, and incredibly formulaic sequel- The Babysitter: Killer Queen is not only a horror installment that didn't need to happen, but a very odd film, that bears the question all throughout, why? Besides the films many frustrating and cliche moments, it does keep a consistent enough pace to keep you entertained. For horror fans, who don't mind the content as long as it is entertaining, the film is a rather average sequel with the same flaws as the first film. Unfortunately for me, being entertaining, was simply not enough. This film is absolutely braindead, with the script having the intelligence level of a very violent 7 year old. There is nothing new about this film, nothing exciting, nothing memorable, and absolutely nothing special. It's just incredibly bland. The acting is as mediocre as the first film, and though the film does seem to finally give us a somewhat interesting character (Phobe), Jenna Ortega's performance just doesn't seem to fit the character on screen, and it ends up making her performance look a bit forced. However, there is very little about this film that isn't forced, whether it is its outlandish plot, plot twists, or incredibly lack of originality- the film doesn't feel like it should have been made, let alone attempted. In the end, The Babysitter: Killer Queen is an unneeded sequel on all fronts, and I would be completely fine with the franchise dying here before this franchise can somehow get even worse out of hand.

tt9196192,6,"I watched this because of the fuss over on social media with people wanting to cancel Netflix. The biggest problem with this film is how it was so poorly mis-marketed. The film is actually a disturbing look at a young girl rebelling against her ""broken"" family.You watch this ""sweet, innocent"" girl fall in with the wrong crowd. A group of swearing kids who are entering a dancing contest. The language changes, her appearance does, her behaviour nose-drives - all the time, she is enticed because of how media sexualises women (models etc in skimpy outfits).Some of the scenes are questionable for sure but I'm not exactly surprised given this is from the country that made Baise Moi. There is no nudity (thank God) and we're shown just enough to know what is going on (such as a young girl taking pictures of her privates to upload to the internet). Unfortunately this is highlighting a real problem in the world though. There are kids doing this because they feel peer pressure. This isn't a make believe film. It's a very real and uncomfortable film. It's deeply unnerving to watch and powerful.

The idea that the actresses were exploited in the making of the film is an interesting question, but not really relevant in the assessment of the film itself. The film is a well done exploration of being a pre-teen/teenage girl in this day in age. For those who are disturbed by it, well yes, you probably should be.

The message in this movie, if done a little more tastefully, could have been a good one. But it was outdone by the hypersexualization of these girls. IF, the cameras didn't focus on the things they did in the way they did, then I would rate this movie 5 stars. Excluding the major controversy surrounding this film, it really wasn't a great movie, just average. My 1 star rating is because these girls were ""used"" in a way they shouldn't have been which was uncomfortable to watch, regardless of how ""real"" it may be.",Cuties,2020-09-09,3.1,27272,2020
tt9196192,6,"Things were even this way years ago when I was growing up. The desire to belong and fit in was so important. All important. To fit in was Everything. To be pretty was Everything. Still is. Society creates an ideal of what a beautiful and desired female should be. That ideal is presented to young girls via magazines, movies, commercials, the internet, etc. It's enacted by every one of us every single day when we complain about our weight, when we purchase those special diet plans advertised on TV, when we discuss our beauty spa appointments for botox, when we sponsor our little girls in toddler beauty pageants. WE perpetuate these ideals for young girls and to young girls. One reason this movie is uncomfortable, because it shows young girls dancing in an explicitly suggestive manner. Maybe the dancing should have been portrayed in a more sort of implied manner.
But don't fool yourselves if you think that girls this age aren't really doing these things. And don't think they haven't been doing it for years. This is neither condoning nor condemning, only stating fact. The (over)sexualization of females isn't new. Is the other reason this movie so uncomfortable, because it doesn't sugarcoat the subject? The only thing that's changed is the technology.",Cuties,2020-09-09,3.1,27272,2020

tt9196192,8,Once I heard it was a French film it didn't surprise me Americans would freak out. You can have a film about a child killing people including their parents and no problems in America . But put an 11yr old in a dance scene in a movie with mature content and take a few clips out of context and we freak out . It was a surprisingly good film and I'm not surprised on the awards. And after watching it I feel that those that are posting the short clips and pictures of the film are exploiting the kids more than the film does or ever will.,Cuties,2020-09-09,3.1,27272,2020
tt9196192,7,"This is a pretty decent but not great movie.This is NOT a family film. It is NOT about sexual exploitation. The backlash against it is ridiculous. I suspect a lot of people don't watch a lot of movies based on what I'm reading here. Stuff like this comes out often, perhaps just not as publicly as Netflix, but more like late at night on an HBO sub channel and it rarely gets noticed.This is a coming of age film about a girl whose friends and their dancing and modern less traditional behavior conflicts with her family's very traditional way of life and religion as she reaches her puberty and her teen years when girls would possibly experience a similar situation. The story is about her internal and external conflict and emotional development in regards to this.The film is decent in that regard, it's a little over the top but you're using young actors and actresses for the most part. Some of the stuff is obviously intended to be presented the way it is to create a more extreme picture of her conflicted mindset.I'm not really sure if people are even actually watching this or just bandwagon jumping against Netflix.",Cuties,2020-09-09,3.1,27272,2020
tt9196192,8,"Thanks to all of the insane outrage associated with this title, I got to watch a very decent movie I most likely would have not watched otherwise. The film is shot from the perspective of an 11 yr old girl desperately trying to fit in, culturally, socially while having to navigate through the confusion of her changing body and everything that goes along with it.
The film illustrates that, in reality, neither culture (traditional African Muslim vs. modern Western European) is particularly friendly to women and their bodies and this reflects heavily on young girls trying to find themselves and their place in this world.
Yes, we live in a misogynistic world and the outrage surrounding this movie only proves the point. It seems that we can't even have an open and honest conversation about how young girls get to experience the world around them without people losing their minds.",Cuties,2020-09-09,3.1,27272,2020
tt9196192,7,"As seen backlash for this film due to its very misleading trailer, and after seeing the film, it is far better and less racy than expected. Much of the hate seemed to stem from people judging without having actually watching the film.As the film it may be quite uncomfortable at times but as a whole, the acting and storytelling is quite engaging and keeps us entertained. It is more of a film of a young and innocent child being exposed and rebellion from a broken family due to peer pressure by exposure of other more ""mature"" girls. This may be a star turning performance by the lead actress.If you watch the film with an open mind and put your biases aside, you can see this is a well made film and the message being sent is evident. There is a reason as to why this film has been praised by critics and is receiving strong reviews.",Cuties,2020-09-09,3.1,27272,2020
tt9196192,8,"I went into this movie expecting to be disturbed. I'd heard all of the commentary on it, but I wanted to watch the film in its entirety before passing judgment.This movie is actually very impressive. The acting is incredible; the directing and cinematography are great. The message is important. Despite what people say, at least 50% of the film is about a Muslim family's customs, traditions, and lifestyle. The other half is about a young girl rebelling.The startling imagery is meant to be just that - startling. It is meant to send a message to the audience about the way sexuality permeates younger and younger demographics.In conclusion, I did not expect to be impressed but I was. There is a lot more meaning to this film than what the critics are claiming.",Cuties,2020-09-09,3.1,27272,2020
tt9196192,8,"This movie at its core is about the performative expectations of young women in modern society and the conflict those expectations can cause.
The main character, Amy, is raised in a traditional Senegalese household and is taught that the exposed female form is to be derided and shamed. On the flip-side she is also a child in the late-2010's bombarded with the expectations of social media, and modern culture at large that prizes raw sexuality and fetishizes youth.Through the course of the film Amy finds that no matter which side she attempts to please or conform to, she finds herself fundamentally unhappy and both cultures, traditional and modern, find her lacking the necessary grace to be accepted.This film discusses the real world struggles for identity and acceptance that many girls deal with on a day-to-day basis, and highlights the stark contrast between the modern performative expectations of sexuality and a girl coming to own her sexuality in a healthy constructive way. Similarly, we see how even when cloistered from ""modern society"" in a Senegalese closed-community the expectations of sexual ownership and femininity are similarly fraught. This is displayed most prominently as Amy's mother finds her husband has taken a second wife without her approval and she (Amy's mother) is expected to carry this burden with grace and without protest.As for as the over-sexualization of the child performers is concerned, I can agree that some of the filmography lingers unnecessarily. I believe a greater distance from the performers would have given the audience a better perspective on what our culture expects (See: Tiktok, Instagram) versus the youth of the performers themselves. The film does not glorify the over-sexualized actions, it condemns them. The film never encourages you to ""enjoy"" these scenes, but to be made uncomfortable for good reason. Young girls should not have societal pressure to be ""performatively sexual enough"" for society. They deserve to come to explore and own their sexuality for themselves and themselves only.This is a nuanced film that deserves a nuanced viewing, and yes, a viewing. If you have not watched this movie in whole you should not be speaking on it. You are speaking from a position of chosen ignorance and even if your feelings about the film don't change after you have seen it, at least you have watched the source material whole-cloth.This is a story about individuality and shrugging off the mantle of societal expectation both modern and traditional.This is a very well told story and I give this movie an 8/10.",Cuties,2020-09-09,3.1,27272,2020
tt9196192,1,"Everyone knows about the twerking scene and them exploiting little girls for the movie. There is absolutely no reason why they had to show the girls twerking throughout the movie. They could've showed the audience or other people reacting to what they were seeing, or have other people talk about what they saw, and no one would hate this movie. But at the same time no one would've saw this movie because there is very little substance apart from the controversy. There is virtually no repercussions for what the characters were doing, the drama isn't interesting or engaging, and overall was just a boring movie. It's clear the director sexually exploited the little girls just to gain controversy and get people to watch the movie. It's sad and disgusting.",Cuties,2020-09-09,3.1,27272,2020
tt9196192,8,"Lost in all the hubbub here is that the director is attempting to depict a real problem faced by many girls in societies that have customs that we find objectionable. She should be commended for her effort. The idea that the girls are being exploited is absurd. Many of those here that are being critical would probably object to the girls gymnastics tournaments that my daughter performs in.

tt9196192,6,"That middle school relationship infightings...I remember those times. The film performance is not very mature, but you can see it portrays to the audience this kind of dance competition, this form of dancing, the hypersexuality derived from
a society that objectifies women and its influence on young and growing children. Why do these seemingly commonplace social phenomena give the audience a sense of discomfort when they're reflected in children? Afterall, we are the models upon which kids learn how to conduct themselves. Should we feel normal for this kind of universal hypersexual performance in adults?",Cuties,2020-09-09,3.1,27272,2020
tt9196192,8,"This film delves deep into the repercussions of young women being left with little to no guidance other than media, as well as what sexual repression in religion can do to a child entering the beginning stages of puberty. Fighting to be noticed and taken seriously, these young women end up doing the opposite, their acting out can only get them so far and they learn the hard way. We also get a great insight look into bullying culture in the age of social media. It is a cautionary tale with a surprisingly freeing ending.",Cuties,2020-09-09,3.1,27272,2020
tt9196192,8,"A real representation of the modern day influences of music video and social media culture on children and adolescents. A well made movie that rightly makes the viewer feel uncomfortable. Rather than attacking the movie and it's makers perhaps more needs to be done to address this discomfort in real terms to preserve the innocence of young girls and boys.I enjoyed the Senegalese Muslim cultural influence on the movie and would have liked the movie to explore the topic of polygamy in more detail. This is especially as the behaviour of the main chatacter ""Amy/ Aminata"" was influenced by her father's impending second marriage with herself and her mother expected to attend and welcome the second wife into their home.",Cuties,2020-09-09,3.1,27272,2020

tt9196192,7,"After seeing all the outrage and disgust on social media and elsewhere regarding ""Cuties"", I watched ""Cuties"" with the mindset that it'd be terrible based off the trailer. After watching it, I can honestly say it really isn't that bad. Everyone that's commenting on it has not had to grow up with social media and felt a collective pressure to fit in.Most Gen-Z can probably relate to this movie in that the main character felt the need emulate what she was seeing on her screen. She along with the other girls in the movie were just doing what they thought it'd take to win. Not only that, but Amy was doing it to rebel. She's growing up in a Muslim Senegalese household, by nature it will be very traditionalist and conservative.This along with the apathy she receives from her mom and her overwhelming need to fit in with the other ""Cuties"" (the friend group) serve as the catalyst for her behavior.She wants to reject the traditionalist and conservative mindsets forced on her by her family so she turns to Western hypersexuality. This is where things start to go downhill (for the viewer and Amy).Even though I am gay, I still felt uncomfortable watching tween girls touch themselves and dance provocatively. Anyone would. But, that behavior is becoming increasingly more common in today's society. I think that's what the film was trying to comment on, young people (especially girls) feeling the need to copy what they see in the media in order to fit in, but it was sadly mistaken as an attempt to normalize pre-pubescent sexual behavior.In the end of the movie, we see Amy reject the Western hypersexuality and the traditional, conservative ways of her family. She just wears a shirt and jeans. Nothing outrageous like in other scenes of the movie. She'll take her own path, not one decided for her. The scene of her jumping rope and gradually jumping higher up is sort of a metaphor for her being able to break a glass ceiling of sorts now that there's nothing holding her back.There are of course things wrong with the movie. There were a lot of plotholes and things that weren't fully explained. Also, the scene where the girls danced for a middle-aged man was very......honestly, uncomfy. I've seen a lot of the things that happened in the movie in real life, but posting sexually explicit pictures for EVERYONE to see? That's new. Those were really the only things that I found wrong.If you watch this movie with an open mind and no preconceived notions, you'll really understand its message.All in all, this movie is probably 7/10, in my opinion. If the plot was better and more things were explained and it was more tamed, I'd give it a 10P.S. To all the hypocrites who say you don't need to depict sexual behavior to comment on it, where's that energy for Toddlers & Tiaras where there's little girls wearing veneers and fake tans or for Unbroken, where the prisoner is tortured? No one is required to depict anything in anyway, it's done to convey a message.",Cuties,2020-09-09,3.1,27272,2020
tt9196192,8,"I took time to watch Cuties last evening on Netfiix. The right-wingers are on an all out campaign to destroy this film. It now has a 2.6 rating on IMDB--the lowest I've ever seen.This film is a very well done coming of age story about a 11 year-old girl growing up in a observant Moslem family in a Paris suburb.
Her father has taken a second wife and she is searching for her own identity. She gets involved with a group of girls who
behave and dance a bit outrageously.Yes, the dancing is suggestive but clearly a mark of adolescent rebellion and very much of today. The acting, script and production values are first rate as is the resolution of the story.
I highly recommend this film.",Cuties,2020-09-09,3.1,27272,2020
tt9196192,8,"The movies showcases two young girls in bad home situations, and how the lack of parenting skills and the normalization of sexy behaviors of pre-teen girls could cause these girls to look for approval in other not-so-nice situations. Pushed on society by marketing and in social media 'likes', with ""Toddlers in Tiaras"" type shows and back to school tshirts for young girls, cropped and stenciled with ""Sexy"" shows how this behavior has become normal.

tt9196192,7,"This film amazingly captures and exposes a rare look into a wide spread pandemic/sub-culture of kids that this generation wants to pretend doesn't exist that are not only influenced by tik-tok, youtube, instagram, twitter, etc.... but are constantly forced to idolize Disney role models like Miley Cyrus, Bell Thorne, and let's not pretend nor forget how music videos are constantly shoved down their throats on their social media feeds on a daily basis from Iggy Azalea, Nicki Minaj, Rhianna, Cardi B, Megan Thee Stallion, Ariana Grande, etc., sound familiar? and then all the hypocrites want to act surprise when young kids turn out like the role models you constantly feed them and pretend it doesn't exist, just like you were shocked when Marilyn Manson appeared on the scene even though you've constantly been throwing it down kids throats for years, gotta love the blatant hypocrisy there lol. Just go on tik-tok and see all the evidence yourself. That's not to point the finger at any of the previously listed role models but this film cleverly points the finger at hypocritical culture itself, because you have to be totally be asleep to not see this coming.The even more interesting fact regarding this film is also how it beautifully brings all the hypocritical, pathetic, two faced, sheep out of the wood-work and to the fore-front, as they all pretend and act like this film is so shocking or surprised at a film could expose such culture that in most cases actually realistically reflects the very childhood that most people don't wanna admit they have either lived themselves or their kids are currently living right now, make no mistake...well guess what.... IT'S NOT A SECRET!!! this film is right on point with our culture to the point it's probably reflecting a huge turning point of the new norm that's here to stay so again why all the uproar? If you find this film offensive perhaps you should look in the mirror. Due to this fact, the rating is totally biased and inaccurate.So as for the film itself, it was a very well scripted piece of cinema, the kids did an amazing job acting out their roles for such a tough subject matter. Love the french accents.",Cuties,2020-09-09,3.1,27272,2020
tt9196192,8,"If I'm being honest, I watched this film because of the controversy that it sparked. However, as the saying goes, you cannot judge a book by its cover (or in this case, it's movie poster) and I was pleasantly surprised.
This film tackles the subject of young girls growing up in a world with cell phones and social media and a predisposed image of what womanhood is. It also shows what happens when there is little genuine parental guidance given to a child who is struggling to discover who they are and where they belong. However, the film predominantly focuses on one girl who comes from a unique background. This girl is from a Senegalese family who has very different cultural values and beliefs than the country that she is now living in, which is France. This girl struggles with going from one extreme to another, as her home life is very different from the life she experiences at school and elsewhere.
At first glance, the film may only appear to focus on provocative dancing. inappropriate behaviors, and a slew of crop tops displayed by a group of children. But these very mature dances, behaviors and clothing are clearly the result of what has been shown to these girls through social media and viral videos that they have come to follow and idolize. This is a very real depiction of what happens in today's world where children as young as 10 are given phones and laptops and access to this kind of material.
And by the way, some of the dancing is SUPPOSED to make you uncomfortable. You are supposed to feel like what you are seeing isn't right. You are supposed to feel the same emotions that many of the side characters feel when they show disgust and disappointment with the girls' actions. I don't think these scenes are glorifying their behavior by any means.These scenes are showing you exactly what is happening in real life. Young girls are learning these dance moves from online. Young girls are wearing crop tops and short shorts and teaching each other how to ""twerk"". This is real life. If you are a parent, you need to pay attention, because this is how social media can influence your child, especially if they are young girls because the only representation they have for what a woman is and what they are supposed to become is what mainstream media is showing them. I personally know this as I am a young woman myself and also struggled with the hyper sexual culture that I felt pressured to adhere to as a preteen.
This film does not endorse or glorify the sexualization of young children. It is a film showing how social media and different cultures can shape a child and why it is so important for the rest of the world to take notes.
Overall, I think it is an important movie that is worth watching. It is risky, bold and in some scenes uncomfortable, but it is also very realistic in many ways.",Cuties,2020-09-09,3.1,27272,2020
tt6772802,8,"Well I had a great review written but it was erased when I switched to another site to fact check some other movies.
What I wanted to say was this is a hard movie to watch. It's hard bc it's honest. We all have our struggles and this is another depiction of an honest struggle families have. In America we like to place labels. In this case the labels are hillbilly, red neck, or white trash. It's all true, but it doesn't mean that's bad. It means it's honest. It makes me think of other honest movies about American families like Crooklyn, Ordinary People or Kramer vs Kramer.
In this year of 2020 the word struggle comes up time and again, but let's not forget another truly American symbolic word .... perseverance. Watch this movie and know that if you're down and feel like the world is against you just keep fighting and persevere. I hope this movie can inspire that feeling.

Here is the reason they are some bad reviews. Some people have never experienced THIS life . They have no idea that people actually do LIVE LIKE THIS .
KUDOS to Ron Howard who also did not grow up in Hillbilly Country but did an excellent job of making this TRUE STORY so accurate on screen.
All the lead actors were amazing and they TRULY portrayed the people they were supposed to be in this.
One of my friends said they only part she didn't like was the CURSING .
"" Did they really need to use that language?"" She asked me .
Absolutely. THAT is normal language for these poor small towns .
If you grew up there you would understand that. F%$@$ was a word I heard as child as commonly as rich people hear "" yes sir"" . It was necessary for them accurately portray these people .
This movie made me cry , because it was TRUE TO LIFE . It brought back many memories for me . I lived this . I too chose to leave and "" be someone.""
Thank you Glen Close for portraying "" Meemaw"" so incredibly well .
I know . I had a Meemaw just like that .

tt6772802,8,"I honestly do not understand the harsh reviews, I watched this movie with low expectations because of what I'd read before going into it but I thought it was fantastic! I don't doubt this will get Amy Adams or Glenn Close a nomination for film awards, at the very least. This movie is definitely emotional and the performances will linger with you after you finish because it is vulnerability and it is weakness, and redemption, and perseverance, and helplessness all at once. Amy Adams is this whirlwind of drama that proves hostile to her family while she struggles with her drug addictions, her son having to cope with the lack of both parental figures with only his grandmother to be his guide and savior throughout his childhood. This movie really kind of gave a window into what addiction does to a person who neither can afford help, or is looking for it, and how complicated life can become. There were so many moments throughout the movie that could have forced Amy Adams' character to confront herself by letting her reap the consequences of her recklessness. But her family behaved like this cushion or a doormat, or a crutch for her misdeeds and drug addictions and the badness would become a cycle, a trend almost, an expected high with a certain inevitable low.There is one particular moment that really got to me, and it was the scene where Glenn Close (Mamaw) is begging a meals on wheels worker to give her more food because she is now taking care of her grandson; a meal for one is split for two and she doesn't think twice about giving her grandson the larger portion of the meal. This just really got to me because although this young man's life was nowhere near perfect, he had someone in his life who pushed him to go further and to try harder and this scene and what happens afterward is probably my favorite thing about this movie.",Hillbilly Elegy,2020-11-24,6.8,27041,2020

tt6772802,8,"As someone who loved the book, the movie was underneath it rating wise but the movie still captures the story and the lessons well. Starting off with the negatives, it focuses too much on the ""current day"" of the movie setting. Vance in his book talked very briefly about his visit home to Ohio to take care of his mother. The movie needed to focus more on his time in the Marines, how before moving in with Mamaw Lindsey pretty much raised him, JD reuniting with his biological father after he thought he abandoned him, and how Papaw was the only real father figure he had. Including more flashbacks that included these key moments in JD's life would have made the movie much better. Now why the critics didn't get it. The movie might have been too smart with the implications it gave the audience. JD is a conservative that provides a different perspective on why the ills of a culture exist. For social constructionists, the movie doesn't make any sense because it doesn't line up with their worldview. JD believes that people get stuck in a cycle of poverty because the culture they grow up in is inherently negative. If JDs mother grew up in a better house and neighborhood and given the proper guidance, she would have been incredibly successful. The book focuses on this much more where the movie hints at it. At what point can you blame her for being a terrible mother? The only way you can get better, to JD, is if you take responsibility for yourself and slowly get better. JD is an exception. The only reason he didn't end up like his mother was because he got lucky in his youth. Of course he worked hard to improve himself, but he happened to have a good enough social network (early on being Lindsey and Mamaw and later Usha) to nudge him in the right direction. The story is not about JD. It's about his mother, who is in the majority, and about how taking personal responsibility is the only way out. The scene that showed when his grandparents moved to Middletown vs it current day is shown when the factories shut down and the jobs left. This is also the area of the country that helped Donald Trump win in 2016. These people are desperate to escape and JD is writing them a letter on how. The government won't save you so the only way is to do it yourself. The movie and book will resonate more with people who understand that struggle and I feel like the critics who don't understand how Trump won will not understand the point of this story either.",Hillbilly Elegy,2020-11-24,6.8,27041,2020

tt6772802,10,"It's a really beautiful movie, for people who want to feel something and dive in it. If you see that, as a critic it doesn't work. I really can't see the reason for the bad critics. It remined me movies like ""Fried green tomatoes"", ""Terms of endearment"" and that was really rare to find in a movie these days. Glenn Close is astonishing. She gives one of her best performances. Couldn't stop crying. Amy Adams is great too. And the music of Hans Zimmer... My God! What a beautiful work. What a moving and touching peace.

tt6772802,7,"Trying to figure out why the critics' score is so different from the user score and all I can think is because the former is detached from the reality of rural white poverty. Living and teaching in an area similar to where J.D. comes from, I see his struggle of trying to escape poverty through education and the impact of drug abuse on communities on a regular basis. It's easy to dismiss this as ""Oscar bait"" and it definitely is...but it's also a movie, though really difficult to watch at points, that tells the uncomfortable reality for far too many.",Hillbilly Elegy,2020-11-24,6.8,27041,2020
tt6772802,10,"This very fine film has a 20 on RottenTomatoes from the critics and an 81 from the viewers. It would be easy to dismiss this discrepancy as an example of how stupid the audience is. Only I am one of the 81. I'll just say this. Years ago I sent one of my movie reviews to Pauline Kael. She loved it. Had me up to her Central Park West apartment the very next evening to discuss it with me. Subsequently, we had many long talks about movie after movie. This isn't to brag. It's to establish my legitimacy.Something is very wrong here with the reviewers. That Amy Adams and Glen Close had to defend the movie as a story having nothing to do with politics says it all. Critics have been swept up in the hyperpolitical craziness of our times. It isn't just Trump and the media. The craziness will continue without him. These critics will eventually learn that the media is going to be a sinking ship, people boxed in by their politics so that they see nothing else. I have had enough of it as have most of the people I know. The reaction to this movie is a fascinating example of this.",Hillbilly Elegy,2020-11-24,6.8,27041,2020
tt6772802,8,"So, I only realized the film was based on a true story at the end of the film. My opinions are my own and I don't claim to be a professional film critic nor do I understand some of their comments. This film was one of the best films I've seen in the last couple of months on Netflix.. This film also reduced me to tears 5 times.As for the acting? I've seen critics label it over the top.. Though myself and others who watched this film with me, all praised the actors within 10 minutes of the film starting.. So this is solely based on your own opinion of what good acting is. I have always been a slightly harsh critic of bad acting and 'B class films' but this films acting had me emotionally invested.As for the political point, not speaking enough on real issues... This is a man's life. HELLO CRITICS, CAN YOU HEAR ME IN THE BACK. Who are we to say that the film lacks the right message? It's based on the life of a man who lived through these very experiences. I read an article speak on Adams acting, ""She's a banshee"".. For all we know this woman could have been exactly like this. Is this Adams fault? Or the real life character?I feel critics are viewing this film as a chance to speak on poverty, political issues etc. This film touches on that and yes the editing can be improved.. but this was someone's life, just as you can't judge the memoir as it was his life, how can you say it lacks the right message?Great film, could have touched more on his time at Yale or atleast how he got there. This film had hours to take us on a journey through someone's incredibly sad, underprivileged life..

tt10919380,7,"It's a little late for a Halloween/slasher movie, but it looks like they really wanted that Friday the 13th release date. And to my surprise, this was way more fun than I thought it would be.Just when you think it's another generic, teen angst, alcohol-drinking, sex-thirsting movie, the kills start happening. Not only were they gory, but they were also quite creative. The movie just knows exactly what it is and never takes itself too seriously. Plus, watching mean bullies die in horrific ways was just so satisfying to watch. (Hopefully, I'm not the only one...)More importantly, Vince Vaughn is the reason you should watch this. You have this 6-foot-5 giant of a man running around as a teenage girl. From the way he speaks to his subtle mannerisms, it was just plain funny. He's the man-- or the woman, I mean.As for the negatives, it mostly has to do with the writing. Basically, everything with the family was boring and predictable. It was probably the most generic part of the movie. They lazily tell you everything you need to know as soon as they're introduced.I also hate it when movies portray a character as ""ugly"" or ""undesirable"" and the actress is anything but. In other words, they want you to believe that Kathryn Newton's Millie is some kind of weirdo loser, but I just never bought it.There's also a disconnect between Newton's Millie, who is shy, timid and quiet, and Vince Vaughn's Millie, who is girly-girl, talkative and fun. They just felt like different people. There's also, sort of, two endings. There was the natural conclusion, and everything was good, but then it goes on for another 10 minutes, and it was just unnecessary.Despite some annoying tropes and poor writing, this was a fun, self-aware movie with some horrific kills and really funny body swap moments.Score: 7 out of 10
Overall: GoodRecommended for: Fans of Vince Vaughn, fans of Freaky Friday with a slasher twist, or fans of watching scumbag bullies get what's coming to them.Thanks for reading!",Freaky,2020-11-13,6.3,27000,2020

tt10919380,8,"I wasn't sure what to expect going in. Everyone, except Vince Vaughn, was an unknown to me and he has been a hit or miss over the last 15 years. The previews showed nothing but a horror comedy so the cold open being an homage to Friday the 13th while taking itself seriously and emoting genuine emotion was a great introduction to the rest of the film which didn't stray from the comedy element like the intro. The female lead played her role well but Vince Vaughn completely stole the show acting as a teenage girl. Writing that sentence feels weird but the performance never gave off an inappropriate or creepy vibe. I found myself laughing hysterically for many of his scenes and the film sent you home with unforced character development and arc for Millie and her family. There are some stereotypical characters, at some points it was an obvious commentary on old horror films but other times came off as a genuine cliché instead of a satirized cliché. With that said it was never distracting and didn't ruin the experience in the slightest with Vince Vaughn stealing every scene he was in.",Freaky,2020-11-13,6.3,27000,2020

The issue is you can't take this movie seriously. It is not meant to be a realistic slasher. It's just an entertaining fun teenage horror comedy and a damn good one!

tt10919380,5,"When I saw the trailer firbthis I was cautiously optimistic that it could be ok. It looked like a Scream meets Freaky Friday. Well, it is that but it is really not very good.Of course this type of horror comedy is not to be taken seriously but it is not very funny or scary at all. The premise is just as the trailer shows. A high school girl gets attacked by a serial killer and they switch bodies. That's it.The serial killer the Blissfield Butcher is played by Vince Vaughn. The high school girl Millie is played by Kathryn Newton. Millie is attacked by the killer with a sacred Aztec dagger that has the power to switch their bodies. The fun of the film is watching each of them adjust in their new bodies. Vaughn does a good job with a very thin script. Newton just goes around looking evil. The film is gory but nothing we've never seen before in much better films. It has a couple of decent chuckles but again been there seen that.The film wants to convince you that it is really cool and edgy but it really isn't.Lazy film.Grade: C-",Freaky,2020-11-13,6.3,27000,2020

Vince Vaught truly carries this movie, Kathryn Newton does a very bad job at pretending Vince, the only thing she does is being quiet and looking like an infant who has to poop. It's the most predictable plot EVER, but the fair amount of slashing makes up for that. Then there are the demonic whispers in the movie, but that is more laughable then scary, I even dare to say there is not 1 scary thing in this movie.

To combine these different genres was a dream come true. I'm glad it's getting such positive reviews. It deserves it. Kathryn Newton was great and so fun to watch her go from a sweet shy vulnerable high school girl named Millie, to bloodthirsty serial killer. Vince Vaughn was great too. It was also fun to see him as an evil killer, turn into Millie and acting like a teenaged girl. The gore and killings were awesome and brutal.Millie Kessler is an average high school girl. Her family is going through a tragedy because of her father dying a year ago. She gets picked on by her peers and even the teachers. The night before the Homecoming dance, she's sitting in the parking lot and the Blissfield Butcher begins to attack her. He stabs her with an ancient Aztec dagger that he stole and that makes them switch bodies.On Friday the 13th, the Butcher wakes up as Millie in her girly bedroom, and Millie wakes up as the Butcher in his gory grotesque lair. Millie must convince her friends that it's her in the killer's body and switch bodies back in 24 hours, or the switch becomes permanent. Throughout the day, the Butcher in Millie's body goes on a bloody rampage. It's so fun to watch.

tt10620868,6,"Typical zombie story. Obviously the budget is limited so the whole movies was filmed in one city block to cut down on expenses.
Decent acting but some details were missed. The boy stayed in that building for so long. And even though he had tainted short hair. And presumably ni beard hair. His look didn't change one bit.
Kind of an obvious point...
Other things like the the fact that zombies hear noise in an apartment several levels up from down in the street. And somehow manage to identify exactly where the noise is coming from. Even for a normal human being. That's extremely difficult.
I could go on for a long time with these remarks but it's ok for a Netflix movie.

The effects were hood with the infected and well acted by all......including the Zombies.
Nothing too gory and the bloody letting is quite restrained really but still nasty enough to give a sense of tension etc.
It's a lot more teenaged and romantically themed that the superior French original ""The Night Ate the World"" which I really enjoyed much more.
But, this is still watchable.
Some big plot holes aside its enjoyable and the sense of being trapped is well conveyed.
More upbeat than expected. Zombies seems a little easily repelled for my liking....but I guess you can't just have the two cast members killed or film over.The fireman scene and use of a drone was interesting.Not as good as the incredible Train to Busan but worth a watch.",#Alive,2020-09-08,6.2,26552,2020
tt10620868,5,"#Alive is a South Korean film by first time director Il Cho. Going into this film I expected an absolute mess, all I had seen was the horrible title. But I was pleasantly surprised with a pretty interesting take on zombie movies. For the most part.Technically I didn't think this film was anything special. No element of filmmaking was exceptional, and no element was awful. Granted there were some awful moments, like the editing when people are turning into zombies is laughable. And the cinematography during action scenes was also just dreadful. For the most part though the technical aspects were consistently, fine.The zombies were very inconsistent. If they are so sensitive to noise why are characters able to talk at all, sometimes when they speak it cuts to hordes of zombies charging in the direction of the sound and this is just forgotten half of the time. Sometimes the zombies are so strong they are able to climb buildings and other times they can't open a door because a step ladder is in the way. I believe this is because of my next point.Bad screenplay. All but two points of tension in this film are down to coincidence. The same scare is used many times, Oh will be doing something like, for example, flying his drone then there is a bang at the door, it's a zombie, at the same moment his drone runs out of battery. The chances of this happening are so slim. The fact screenwriters Il Cho and Matt Naylor use this stupid scare so many times makes me think they just didn't care when writing this film. The dialogue is bad and everything feels lazy.The constant references to pop culture to try and relate to a younger audience really began to annoy me after a while. From the title to the main character Of being a gaming streamer. But the filmmakers don't really know how technology works, holding your phone in the air does not give you more reception. I hate when films waste so much time trying to be hip and down with the kids. By doing this it sacrifices so much time the film could be using to develop characters or create a more compelling narrative.Overall, #alive is a pretty stupid movie that is just ok the whole way through. Check it out if you like zombie movies.",#Alive,2020-09-08,6.2,26552,2020

There's a great scene where our man looks outside fearfully, and then looks at his food rations, something many people have done in 2020.It's very nicely acted, nicely shot, it feels very fresh and current. The moments of horror were very nicely done, and never became too silly. Some nice twists, it's never predictable.It has a real sense of doom, and terror about it, the way things gradually collapse, that said the action begins quickly, they don't hang around.It's good, 7/10.",#Alive,2020-09-08,6.2,26552,2020

tt10620868,6,"I'll admit that the posters for #Alive had gotten the zombie-movie fanatic within me pretty excited. The urban setting, the spectacular make-up effects, the 'few survivors vs. a massive zombie horde' storyline, and the use of modern-day gadgets - I was quite enticed by these factors. #Alive has a fantastic first act - it's all Yoo Ah-in until then, and of course, the gratifying zombie chaos taking place around his apartment complex. Add some food-related FOMO to that and we have an interesting bunch of scenes stitched together.As expected, not much is detailed about the outbreak except for the basics - these zombies are fast, cannibalistic, and attack in hordes. Things change around the 40-minute mark with the entry of a female survivor (played by Park Shin-hye) who lives across the complex in another building. Hereafter, the cliches start to pile up. They develop a vibe, a couple of walkie-talkies are conveniently found, and they even end up saving each other at different instances. Yet, it's the predictably bland final act that makes #Alive a middle-of-the-road effort.The set-pieces are all racy, hair-raising, and effective, even if one feels tempted to revisit and question how certain scenes play out. With a highly animated zombie mob hot on the trail of the protagonists from start to finish, the action has a well-choreographed feel to it. #Alive, when viewed as a quarantine film in the year 2020, can also send a message across to people that all hope is never lost and personal battles can eventually be won.",#Alive,2020-09-08,6.2,26552,2020

And regarding zombies, the truth is that they are disturbing in a way and if I can consider this movie a little more morbid, you can even see how zombies take their bodies to eat them with others! The only downside is that sometimes you think, How come zombies don't attack them right away? Well, it is a movie and the protagonists must fight to survive.

tt10620868,6,"Oddly enough I hadn't even heard about ""#Alive"" before getting the opportunity to sit down and watch it. And even more surprising is that I am a huge fan of zombie movies, so the fact that ""Alive"" had eluded me was odd.Nevertheless, this being the year that the highly anticipated ""Peninsula"" - the sequel to ""Train to Busan"" - also coming out, it was a little bit strange to find another zombie movie from the South Korean cinema. Not that I mind that, no, no, no. Not at all. In fact ""#Alive"" (aka ""#Saraitda"") actually turned out to be more enjoyable and entertaining than ""Peninsula"" was. Yeah, I know, right...Anyway, I will say that ""#Alive"" is not your average run-of-the-mill zombie movie. And I love the way that the movie starts out and just throws the audience right into the action. That was just glorious. I liked that so much, because the zombie action is what is enjoyable, not the things leading up to it.The acting in ""#Alive"" was good, and the lead actor and actress managed to carry the movie quite well, especially since there were hardly any other performers in the movie with dialogue.The zombie make-up and effects were good, and taking into consideration that this was in the beginning of an outbreak, you shouldn't expect to see fully decomposed shambling corpses. Normally I am not overly keen on running and agile zombies, but I will say that it actually worked out well enough in ""#Alive"", for some reason.If you enjoy zombie movies, then you definitely should take the time to sit down and watch the 2020 movie ""#Alive"" from writer and director Il Cho, because it does bring new contents to the zombie genre.I am rating ""#Alive"" a six out of ten star. Quite worth the time, money and effort, and a well-worthy addition to the zombie genre. So it seems that 2020 did end up with a proper zombie movie after all.",#Alive,2020-09-08,6.2,26552,2020

tt10620868,5,"My issue with this film is that the main character acts so strangely and childishly to the point that half of the time, the film was extremely difficult to watch. It didn't help that he looks rather odd as well, and his garish blonde hair doesn't help. This is especially a big issue because, at least for me, the film just drags so much. He acts like a teenage shut-in. It was just unbearable. I literally paused the movie several times before the introduction of the main female character.It's not until about 40 minutes into the movie that we finally are introduced to another character that survives for a long period of time (Kim Yoo-bin). I loved her character. She was smart, mature, kind, and caring. Had it not been for her, the main character literally wouldn't have survived.I do wish it was established why exactly she chose to save his life and why she didn't choose to step in earlier. I also don't understand how both she and the main character could survive for such a long period. The film really suffers from an insufferable and bumbling lead. You'd think the film's writers would make Yoo-bin the lead, since she was much more capable and charming, but for whatever reason we're stuck with an annoying lead and a great secondary lead. Last, but not least, the film really suffers because it takes place really just in that one location with the same repetitive things happening over and over. This definitely isn't at all on the same level as movies like Train to Busan and 28 Days Later; both those films outclass this film by miles.

tt10620868,5,"First of all, the trailer is very appealing, especially to a avid fan of ""zombie genre"" film. it was shown in the trailer the use of drone which the viewer would think that it would be a significant tool for them to survived, but it is not useful as you would expect in the trailer. there are thing that i've noticed in the film that made me rate it lower than 6:1. Continuation
there is a part in the film where the protagonist was shocked when the door was shaking. the refrigerator was stumble and the zombie was able to enter the room. the protagonist have to fight back in order for him to survive, however in some parts of the film the door was actually ""pulled"" from the outside in order for it to be open.
in contrary there's one zombie that was using his hand on the lever of the door to open, hence, there's a possibility that the zombie that the protagonist have fight with maybe used is hand to open it, HOWEVER...2. the way zombies act is inconsistent
i mention that there's one zombie shown in the film that used his hand to open the door, however in some parts of the film, the zombies are not mentally capable of opening the doors, they are just pushing themselves and slamming the door with their hand. it was also mention in the television that the zombies act aggressively but when both protagonist was running upon the 8th floor, it seems like some of the zombies are not that ""aggressive""3. cuts
the film is ""drama and adventure"" genre. there was a part where the main protagonist was outrageous for the lost of his family that he decided to go outside and try to let it out by fighting the zombies. he realized that he couldn't fight all of them because there are a lot of them. while he was running the camera turn in the zombies without knowing whether there's a zombie in front of the protagonist or not. the next scene was already him hinding in the corner. for some reasons they decided to cut the part where he run to hide in the corner which is very important since this is an adventure film. that little detail would help the audience feel as if they were there.4. stupid character.
i don't want to explain it anymore, i don't know how they survived, they are just stupid5 cliche villain

But I was wrong, and I am so glad I was.Another reviewer said that this is ""woke"" and a commentary on immigration, it isn't, not at all. This is not a film about race or the differences in race or the difficulties of adjusting to living in a new country, it's not trying to say anything about the immigration system it's just telling a story that happens to involve new immigrants to a country, saying this is a commentary on immigration is like saying Jaws is a commentary on water safety or Die Hard 2 is a commentary on airport security.This film is a supernatural horror about the desperate things that people will do to survive and the consequences of those actions, and it's one of the most entertaining horrors I've seen for a while with some genuinely unsettling scenes, I can only hope people don't dismiss it because of a few ignorant reviewers who see imaginary agendas whenever there are black characters leading a film.8/10",His House,2020-10-30,6.5,26253,2020
tt8508734,8,"There are so many terrible films, particularly in the horror genre, on Netflix at the moment. This is not one of them. All the horrors I've watched recently are either far too dumb, or too far the other way - relying on being artsy or having powerful imagery but sacrificing a satisfying story. This one gets it just right. It is genuinely intriguing but leaves you with a resolution. There are layers of interpretation, but also a nice clear cut story.I found for a good part of the film I thought it was just a theme of asylum seeking; a couple fleeing something bad and arriving at a not-beautiful side of Britain, with the man trying to adjust to a new culture and then woman conversely holding onto her roots, all through the narrative of an apparently haunted house. The pair being explicitly warned that they might be sent ""back"" if they made any trouble, or didn't integrate properly, emphasised this theme. But it turned out to be about something quite different - something I can't really say without giving away the plot substantially. It could have been based on anyone with a past, and the fact that the main characters were refugees worked well for the narrative but was not the entire theme.It was well cast and very well acted, which is not actually all that typical in many films being streamed at the moment. Matt Smith is in it but as a side character: they don't try to force him into it beyond his welcome just to exploit the well known name; also refreshing. He is good in his part, but the two leads are allowed to shine.I'm not much of an artistic critic but I felt they built and maintained the atmosphere brilliantly. I can't even tell you if it was visuals or score or lighting or whatever because I'm not the type of audience to dissect that - I just know it gripped me and took me with it emotionally. The tension is good and there were jump scares that work well. Personally I can't stand a film that's just reliant on jumpy moments or gore and lacks any actual substance. This, to me, gives the best of all worlds. And when it ended I felt genuinely glad I'd watched it, and watched it to the end.Honestly this little film buried far below the (poorer quality) netflix recommendations was a very positive surprise for me and I would definitely recommend watching.",His House,2020-10-30,6.5,26253,2020

tt8508734,6,"His House starts great and it also ends strongly. However, that beginning and that ending feel like they are from two different movies. It's quite unfortunate that it made me feel that way because I do think that there is a lot of things that this movie gets right.Let's start with the first half of the movie. What I would consider the horror half. This film began very quickly and left very little time for the viewer to get situated. The first 45 minutes were indeed very scary, and I was drawn to the screen. But what made that first half so great, was that it didn't just rely on the usual horror tropes.
His House explored themes of racism and all the other challenges that refugees face. These issues were explored in a way that caused tension even outside of the house that works as the centrepiece of the story. Another aspect that created its own horror was distrust and challenges of marriage. This film managed to create an atmosphere of constant terror and tension, and I, for one, really liked it.The second half, however, moves into a completely different direction. What started as a pure horror film, shifts more and more into a drama as the run time moves towards its end. The horror changes from the typical haunted house style more into creature horror. That's also where the movie stopped being scary for me. I have never found creature horror to be particularly scary and this film didn't change that. I do realize that that is a personal problem, and most people will probably find the second half to be nearly as scary as the first one.
But it's not just the normal horror stuff that changes. The two aforementioned aspects of immigration and marriage are almost completely forgotten about. And it is quite unfortunate that this is the case. I felt that they added so much to this movie and made it more than just another haunted house film.With that being said, I did like the second half nearly as much as I liked the first one. His House end up becoming a rather touching drama by the time it finishes. And if it forgot about the challenges of immigration and marriage, it replaced it with the conundrum of whether to leave ones home country in the first place. Although a new home promises a better life, is that always going to be the reality?There is a lot to like about His House. I think that it fantastically approached horror by making it about more than just jump scares and a scary atmosphere. I also liked that it was a haunted house film that didn't take place in an abandoned mansion. And, I also liked the second half with everything it had to offer. The thing that lessened my excitement was the fact that I felt like I ended up watching two different films. Had there been more cohesion between the two halves, I'm certain that I would've liked this film quite a bit more.",His House,2020-10-30,6.5,26253,2020

tt8508734,9,"This movie was amazing. There are so many metaphorical meanings behind the film and it was interesting to see what happens at the end. The fact that the story of refugees was told is amazing because you hardly hear those stories. Let alone see it in horror films. The scary moments were actually scary, there were elements I've never seen in any movie, etc. The actors all embodied their roles well.
Great Job, Remi",His House,2020-10-30,6.5,26253,2020
tt8508734,6,"The horrors that asylum-seekers have to put themselves through when meshed with a haunted house storyline is what we get in Netflix's His House. Bol (Dirisu) and Rial (Mosaku) are refugees fleeing their war-torn country of Sudan; they brave bullets, rough waters, and even lose their daughter as they finally arrive in Britain where they're granted probational asylum. They're temporarily moved into a shabby, crumbling house in the London suburbs, and that's when the past begins to haunt them.His House is a pretty strong directorial debut from Remi Weekes, who has also written the screenplay. It may just be a 93-minute film, however, His House manages to dive equal parts deep into the struggles of immigrants as well as survivor guilt. While Bol tries to blend in with the new surroundings (he sings football anthems at bars, changes his attire, and prefers to use tables while eating), Rial holds firmly onto their culture (she wears their daughter's necklace, dresses in vibrant colors, and sits on the floor while eating).The scares, the greatest thing about horror films, are well-conceived. Weeks mixes jumpscares with more atmosphere-heavy ones in an effort to keep viewers on edge. Practical and visual effects are put to solid use in these sequences, though some fare better than others. A little inspiration has been drawn from films like The Conjuring and Lights Out, in a good way. Weekes, through some effective crafting that blur the lines between fantasy and reality, elevates His House beyond the conventional haunted house movie.Not everything works though. The final act switches horror for a somewhat predictable twist, and while the closing frames make for a powerful set of metaphors, it feels slightly sketchy from a closure standpoint. The performances are good for a film that revolves mostly around two (or three, if you include the beast) characters - Dirisu and Mosaku showcasing credible, lived-in feats.",His House,2020-10-30,6.5,26253,2020
tt8508734,8,"If you're a fan of in-your-face horror, this film is deeply psychological and not for you. Although politics lay the foundation for the story, the story itself isn't really about immigration.

The leads are just brilliant and utterly convincing as a married couple who have literally been to hell and back. Remi Weekes, the director, has a very sure hand with horror and breathes some fresh life into the haunted house/demonic posession/witchcraft genre. A very small cast, a disconcerting and claustrophobic atmosphere and winning leads make an original and fresh movie.

tt8508734,7,"His House is a beautifully acted movie about a Sudanese refugee couple who are moved into a rundown house in England. The house turns out to be haunted, and there are a number of questions left up to the viewer to decide by the end. The movie does a neat trick of making it clear exactly why the couple can't just leave this house once the haunting starts. They have strict rules in place to maintain their asylum status, and one of those rules is they don't leave that house before they're told that they can. There's conflict between the husband and wife, as he is eager to assimilate while she wants to hold onto their culture. The ominous mood is set up early, as the house they are given is large enough for two families but they are being given it to themselves and the rehousing agent (Matt Smith) acts shifty about it and won't explain why they have this house to themselves. The house has been used as a trash dumping ground by the neighborhood kids, so it has fallen into an abandoned state and they wind up having to fix up parts of it just to have livable conditions. There are holes in the walls from which come whispering sounds. And from the very first night, there are jump scares and WTF moments, and some pretty good ones too. The wife, Rial, becomes convinced that a ghost from their past has followed them to England. The husband, Bol, doesn't want to hear it at first. They have a big secret between them, a major source of guilt. Whatever is in their house is feeding on it. The thing is, if the ghost followed them there, why do other people who have lived in the neighborhood longer treat their house like it's haunted? The movie hints that there might be something much older occupying that space but never explains it fully. However, the movie does manage to come to a mostly satisfying resolution.",His House,2020-10-30,6.5,26253,2020

tt11989890,10,"David Attenborough has been a part of my life since I first started watching nature programmes when I was a very little boy (I was born 1968)In nearly 70 years of film making he has pretty much visited every place possible on the planet and travelled millions (literally) of miles to do so.He has never failed to awe and wow us with the wonders of the planet.So when SIr David, at the age of 94, makes a new, one off film with the strapline ""My witness statement"", you have to sit up and take notice.I decided to see this on it's release date in the cinema, to really immerse myself in the wonders of the world on a big screen.The film opens with Sir David in the ruins of Chernobyl where he shows the results of ONE stupid, mammoth mistake and then leads into the state of the world today.SIr David takes you on a journey through his life, showing population levels, CO2 levels and %age of the planet still classed as WILD each time. He presents the facts in his warm caring style but showing a picture of how bad things have got.STATISTIC : Of all the animal biomass on earth, 60% is estimated to be human livestock, 36% humans and a mere 4% for everything else.The narration pauses with about 30s of silence and the look on his face says everthing - no acting just a man looking back over the years - brought a lump to my throat.But after all the doom and gloom he says ""This is my witness statement. But it doesn't end there, we can fix this and I'll tell you how""Fo the second part he talks about all the ways we can, as a world and a species, start to fix things and put them right. But these are not just pie-in-the-sky methods, he talks and shows about how positive change is ALREADY happening. Watch for the examples from the Netherlands & Costa Rica.He talks about the human population peaking and how we can make this happen sooner by actually IMPROVING people's lives - no draconian fertility laws, just the course of nature.SO he ends on a positive note - he really believes we can fix this and based on the fact Costa Rica DOUBLED its jungle and forest cover after mass deforestation in just 25 years and when you see how nature has reclaimed Chernobyl it will hearten you too.The fixes don't require us to deny ourselves but to manage things BETTER and in fact if we do things BETTER we will have even more.Now we just have to get our politicians, especially the deniers, to wake up and DO SOMETHING.I honestly believe that anyone who gives this show a negative or neutral review or rating (under 6) either has completely missed the point OR is a denier and there is no hope for them at the moment.Final thought - Many scientists have said that the lost of biodiversity on the planet at the moment is so great and so rapid that it has to be classed at the 6th Great Extinction Event the planet has suffered in the 4.5 billion year history. Whatever happens, life WILL flourish again, but the question will be, ""Will humans be part of it or will we go the way of the dinosaurs?""",David Attenborough: A Life on Our Planet,2020-10-04,9,25587,2020

I seriously wholeheartedly hope most people on this planet will watch this documentary and especially world leaders and government officials! Not to mention this documentary is just Incredibly educating and should be shown in schools eventually. There is zero excuse not to see this movie. ZERO! This is a MUST watch for everyone. Because we all call Earth our home and there is NO Planet B for us! There is NO denying the scientific evidence and vitally Important message this movie gives. If you deny it you are a stupid non intelligent human being who should NOT be allowed to be in charge and make big decisions on anything period!

As I was watching it, I often felt the need to look away, even though I knew that I would be closing my eyes to the harsh truth of our planet's decay if I did. My advice? Do not look away from this documentary for a second. It will show you seemingly irreversible damage done to this earth, but give you specific hope that'll make sure not all will be lost. It will show you that everything that has been destroyed can be rebuilt. My personal favorite part is where he shows us that this is not about saving our planet: it's about saving ourselves. Because if humanity perishes due to its own errors, life will start anew anyway. It's all about the legacy we leave behind that will determine whether our species becomes extinct... or gets to live another century to see the world rise from the ashes we created.All in all, a convincing documentary, not with necessarily lots of new visual content, but rather an incredibly moving, personal story beautifully tied together with video footage and fantastic music.",David Attenborough: A Life on Our Planet,2020-10-04,9,25587,2020

He presents us with a pathway to recovery, a way to repair, to make amends.

Make today the day that you decide to change your world and, by doing so, help to re-establish and rebalance the scales of nature that have been so biased and skewed by the sinister and greedy enterprises of fossil fuels, inorganic mammal and poultry production, these manufacturers and machines of chaos - make a difference today, make a difference tomorrow but above all make a difference while you still have the chance to make that difference, and a chance to make that difference count!",David Attenborough: A Life on Our Planet,2020-10-04,9,25587,2020

Octavia Spencer was so over the top camp , Chris rocks voice over was overly excited considering he is narrating a story that is about evil withches and the danger they pose towards children ..The whole film was so badly miscast it makes showgirls look like pride and prejudice, Hollywood u have to stop now remaking classic movies , come up with some new ideas and make new movies diverse. We do not need to erase iconic movies from the past just to tick the diversity quota , make new movies new ideas and just be diverse ....Anne Hathaway really should be kept away from icnonc roles like this.

tt0805647,3,"The Grand High Witch is killing it. but seriously, she's terrible.
From the start on, with the weird Chris Rock voice-over, this remake goes wrong wherever it can wrong. The acting is stiff, the focus is hardly on all the other witches, the CGI is not good. Even the housekeeping cart seems to come from the CGI box. Positive thing: Octavia Spencer is doing her best to be a genuine grandmother, and she succeeds, but that's about it.
OK, yes, I am a fan of the 1990 movie. Even though it wasn't as close to the original story, I really can't believe Roald Dahl would recognize his book in this mess. The first movie was gorgeous in it's authenticity. It has folklore, it has an edge, it has a heart. This is Hollywood factory work and seems to want to be much more than it can deliver. It made me miss much more than the purple glow in the witches eyes. It made me want to just throw up like a witch who smells children.

Then, if you are gonna do it, well, do it well. They were clearly going for a kids friendly movie but I mean, this story is creepy. The mouse animation takes you away from it, specially coming from Henson's animatronics. The Great Witch reveal is underwhelming, and the changes/additions to the story don't serve it. It just doesn't adds up.It pains me that Cuaron and Del Toro are attached to this project as producers. Zemeckis seems to be going in decline and it just sucks.

I didn't understand why they had to remake the witches, the original felt authentic and was engaging and fun. The grandma and little boy made a great team and you rooted for them! This one was boring in places, all the actors (except Octavia Spencer) were dreadful, the little boy especially! And Chris Rock as the voice over was annoying, at times you couldn't hear /understand what he was saying!
My children found it frightening, the way Anne Hathaway's mouth opened with those teeth and her extending arms was very much like the clown from IT and the CGI was so obvious. And what accent was she supposed to have? At times it was Scottish/Irish and some kind of Eastern European!!?

It just takes away from the original and that is not what you want when you are making a remake.Like i was looking forward to seeing the hotel in this film. The original hotel was so iconic to me, it just really stuck with me and when i watched it was like like i really want to go to this fabulous hotel on the cost in the UK. This hotel looked so bad, i honestly think it was CGI. It looked fake, like all the exterior shots looked like it was a CGI hotel.Speaking of CGI, there is so much in this film and it just looks stupid. They lean so heavy on it. The original uses make up and animatronics so well and it just works to make the film seem more rooted in our word and just more pleasing to look at. I also think it is incredibly lazy to just CGI. That word pretty much sums up this movie.The acting was fine apart from Anne who was chewing up the scenery like it was going out of fashion. She was the best part of the move i guess. Well her costumes were to be honest. But they even used CGI in her costumes!! It was infuriating. Her accent was absolutely horrible tho.

I even thought that with actors like Octavia Spencer, Stanley Tucci and Anne Hathaway that it might be saved, and they were great in their roles as far as remaking/re-imagining movies go. But even with that, the grandmother is sort of a rehash of Spencer's character Minnie from The Help, Stanley Tucci hardly gets ANY screen time or character development, and Hathaway, while nailing so many of Angelica Houston's mannerisms, is still a bit overdone on her character. But also the remake lacks the character/story development, decent plot, dialogue and even the action and tense scenes from the original. And the transformation scenes (minus the one in the beginning which I thought was a good add) were extremely short with bad CGI.

It's a light-hearted feel good film that has a few genuine laughs and isn't as cringe as ""kid spy"" movies tend to be. We watched it on Amazon Prime due to the virus but I imagine it would have been better to watch with other people in theaters.My only gripe was the unnecessary bad language. Repeatedly hearing b***h and s**t in the Cardi B song when it only takes 30 seconds to use the clean version for a movie that's marketed to kids and young families.",My Spy,2020-06-26,6.3,23514,2020
tt8242084,5,"It's pretty formulaic. It's pretty predictable. Thus, not very interesting.But, it has its moments. Most jokes are formulaic and predictable, but, quite a few are not and work well.

There's not enough of these good jokes to make this a good comedy, but, enough to make it acceptable.While the girl isn't as cute as she thinks she is, she actually plays the ""smart & cocky"" girl pretty well and her interaction w/Bautista works well. Her mom fits the ""hot mom"" part very well; she doesn't act it very well, though, but, just good enough.The boss is pretty lame, the quirky nerd-partner doesn't really work...

tt8242084,5,"My Spy is a new family action comedy directed by Peter Segal, the director of Get Smart and Tommy Boy.The film is about the ex-military JJ (Dave Bautista), who after his time in the army now tries to work as a CIA agent. During his missions he still works too much as a soldier. The CIA does not get the necessary information and decides to use JJ for undercover operation. JJ now has to spy on mother Kate (Parise Fitz-Henley) and her young daughter Sophie (Chloe Coleman) in the hope that her arms trade partner contacts his family. JJ is soon discovered by the clever nine-year-old Sophie, who promises to share nothing about his secret mission with the rest of the world. In return, JJ has to train her on how to become a spy herself.This movie has his amusing moments about how a young girl can outsmart a novice CIA agent. This aspect has come up before in other films such as the Arnold Schwarzenegger film Kindergarden Cop. For people familiar with such films, this film can quickly become predictable. The script clearly shows the bond between JJ and young Sophie, but the film concentrates a bit too much on this band at a time. For example, the aspect of the secret arms trade is somewhat canceled. The scenes that pass here seem a bit like separate scenes from a completely different film. These different aspects only come together at the end of the film, but otherwise seem to have little in common.The comedy moments are also somewhat predictable if you are familiar with these kinds of comedy movies. Dave Bautista comes across as a budding CIA agent who doesn't yet know how to best handle his job. While it seems a bit unbelievable that the CIA is discovered by a nine-year-old girl and she manages to outsmart them, these moments make for the best comedy in the movie. For a novice young actress, Chloe Coleman does good and appropriate acting in this film. The better known comedy actors such as Kristen Schaal and Ken Jeong still have more of a cameo in this film and only have a few small comic moments.",My Spy,2020-06-26,6.3,23514,2020
tt8242084,5,"""My Spy"" is nothing original but still manages to be filled with action, sweet at its core and entertaining.
.
In this action-comedy, a CIA operative finds himself at the mercy of a 9-year-old girl, having been sent undercover to surveil her family.
.
While we've all seen this genre of film before, ""My Spy"" stays away from being a ""family friendly"" movie and goes more for stylized action and mild cursing. It's worth the watch just to see Dave Bautista and Chloe Coleman together. They're cute, fun and Coleman is great. For a night in quarantine, this easy going flick is a safe bet for young and old.

If you only need a fun and simple movie, without a twistet story you need to stay focused on, then it is a fun little movie where you can just turn your brain of and enjoy it.The story is fairly simple, sometimes even predictable, there aren't any big moments you will still remember in a few years, there is no 'real espionage action"" which you might hope for and of course you could have done more with it. And I must be honest. I myself expected something a bit different from this movie in the beginning and by the trailers. But I like what it is. I can enjoy the charackters and their interactions, I can laugh at a lot of the jokes, and I can simply sit here and enjoy the simple story, without the need to figure out what is happening and I think this is something you could need on a bad day.So If you want a fun and little movie for your evening after a hard day or for you and your Family, this movie might be worth a Shot.",My Spy,2020-06-26,6.3,23514,2020

There was some violence and language but nothing bloody or disgusting.",My Spy,2020-06-26,6.3,23514,2020
tt8242084,8,"IN A NUTSHELL:
A massive, burly spy and a precocious, adorable 4th grader. Sounds like a comedic match we have seen many times before (movies with Arnold Schwarzenegger or Dwayne Johnson), yet the funny formula still works. At least, it did for me, my husband, and the majority of the audience who watched a press screening of this spy comedy last night. The movie isn't exactly ""Fifty shades of amazing"" as one of the character says in the film, but it was still super entertaining and made my tired husband laugh MANY times. That's a huge compliment and endorsement of this spy comedy. We both thought it was cute and enjoyable, despite the many negative reviews we've seen online.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
A surprising amount of profanity for a family-friendly flick. Some crude language.
Lots of violence with a high dead body count. You see a severed head fly by in slow motion, a man get a knife thrown into his leg, tons of people get shot or blown up, hand-to-hand combat, and a variety of weapons.
Two gay men who live together play a large role as neighbors to Sophie. Sophie assumes Bobbi is a lesbian, which is never confirmed, nor denied.
Tons of pop culture references to things young kids may not know anything about like ""Queer Eye"" Brawny Towels, Waze, and lots of older movies. The movie really seems more tailored to older viewers than as a kids' movie.THINGS I LIKED:
Dave Bautista was never on my radar until I first saw him in Guardians of the Galaxy (Theatrical). I LOVE those movies. I'm such a fan of his now and want him to do well in movies like his professional wrestler mentor Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. Dave Bautista seems up for anything and is willing to take some heavy hits and look goofy. Good for him. There is only one obvious body-double moment in the movie when he's ice skating; otherwise, that seems to really be him getting knocked all over the place.
Chloe Coleman is fantastic. I've never watched Big Little Lies. She's occasionally annoying in the movie, but mostly totally adorable.
Kristen Schaal almost always plays a quirky, likable character. She's definitely a highlight in this movie with some of the funniest lines in the cast.
Ken Jeong is always a crowd pleaser, although he usually plays super nasty, crass characters in comedies. I'm happy to announce that he was perfectly clean, although it surprised me that e was used more as a straight man, rather than the funny man that he always is. I've been watching him lately on THE MASKED SINGER and he seems like he'd be a fun guy to hang with who genuinely loves to laugh at anything, including himself.
Because I love movies so much, I always get a kick out of movies that reference or quote other movies. In this funny flick, there were tons of shout-outs to other films, such as Iron Man 2, Notting Hill, E.T.,The Extra-Terrestrial, Mission: Impossible, Shrek, and Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark
I know action sequences in slow motion are super cliche, but I love them anyway. The ones in this movie always got a laugh from the audience.
The music choices supported the comedy and were even the focus of some comedic moments.
I'm completely obsessed with Alexa, so I love that Dave Bautista had one too.
Tons of physical gags that made me laugh out loud like the blinking lesson or when Bobbi started doing bicep curls with her tiny water bottle after watching JJ curl massive water tanks.
I always love a good training sequence.
A cute twist. I love twists and surprises.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
Some painfully corny dialogue.
Some people have been complaining that the film doesn't know what it wants to be: action, comedy, coming-of-age, rom-com, or spy movie. It really was all of those things. I think it has to do with expectations. I expected a comedy with a spy setting, so that's what I saw.
You watch Bobbi throw up. Ick.
Did they spray paint the top of Dave Bautista's head or was that his actual hair? It was super distracting and seemed to be the wrong color.
Super predictable.
Some of the acting by side characters is not very good, particularly the other kids. Hey, they're kids.
All of the explosions with fire had really fake-looking CGI.
For a spy movie, there were no super cool, new gadgets. Everything was very old-school.
The rolling credits at the end of the movie just showed clips from the movie, nothing new. I love it when comedies include after-credit scenes to extend the laughter that everyone came to the movie to enjoy.
There are some plot holes, but this movie is not trying to be a serious spy movie, so don't worry about themYou can watch the rest of my review on my Movie Review Mom YouTube channel!",My Spy,2020-06-26,6.3,23514,2020

That little Chloe Coleman is an amazing actress, and combining her with the amazing Dave Bautista was probably the smartest casting choice this year. For that matter, the entire casting was on point. The directing was great, as was the cinematography and sound. The 99 min runtime and pacing were perfect.

This awkwardness may in part be because the movie seems to be distorting the plot and dialogue to show off how woke they are.

Turns out I was wrong. I am so disappointed.This one is lame, script writing-wise. I only like the idea of the bond between two main characters yet unfortunately the execution is mediocre. Everything else is just boring, predictable cheesy drama, not even close to being a solid action comedy. Dave Bautista is a good actor. I like him (his performance) best in Blade Runner 2049 (2017). But not in this spy thingy.I wonder what Peter Segal thought when he read the lame script and why he'd accept it in the first place. I feel sorry for him. I like his 'more entertaining' work in Get Smart (2008).I give my generous 3 stars for the warm lil family vibe--despite its predictable cliche.",My Spy,2020-06-26,6.3,23514,2020

tt8242084,7,"So as the school holidays comes to an end in Australia we finish off with yet another release of a children's film. The funny part is that it's a bit like a recipe, as it contains parts of all the other films I've reviewed already these summer holidays! You take the machismo of Playing with Fire, add the silliness of Farmageddon, plus a touch of heart from Frozen 2, not forgetting some funny one-liners from Jumanji, finish it off with some espionage from Spies in Disguise, garnish it with the child-friendly action of Star Wars and you have a perfectly satisfying film called My Spy. Mr. 9 and I ate it up (and reviewed it) last week when we saw it at Palace Nova cinemas!JJ (Dave Bautista) is an undercover CIA agent who is not exactly inconspicuous. After a weapons deal goes horribly wrong he is assigned to surveillance duty with tech-specialist Bobbi (Kristen Schaal). Their job is to keep an eye on a mother and daughter who may be in danger if a global terrorist finds out where they live. But JJ isn't exactly qualified for surveillance duty and it's not long before he is caught out by clever 9 year old Sophie (Chloe Coleman), the girl he is supposed to be watching. The two work out an arrangement where Sophie won't tell her mum Kate (Parisa Fitz-Henley) that they are being watched, but only if JJ teaches Sophie how to become a spy. The two don't exactly get along but over time a friendship develops, much to the chagrin of Bobbi who knows that this is a serious breach of the CIA surveillance rules. But, as expected, trouble inevitably finds its way into Sophie and Kate's life and we are left to see whether the spy training that JJ gave this precocious 9 year old will succeed or fail spectacularly.THE GOOD
For a film like this, with a storyline that has been done to death plenty of times before, I was actually surprised at how much I liked My Spy. But my enjoyment didn't come so much from former WWE wrestler Dave Bautista (Guardians of the Galaxy, Stuber) but the confidence and acting ability of kid actor Chloe Coleman (Big Little Lies). In a lot of these 'kids teaching adults to be kids' films the child usually comes across as bratty and unlikeable but Coleman finds a great balance of clever, likeable and entertaining which Mr. 9 and I really found appealing. Also when you have a great comedy support cast like Kristen Schaal (Gravity Falls, Toy Story 4) and Ken Jeong (The Hangover movies) the laughter also lifts a notch too.
Mr.9: I really liked Sophie in this film when she is learning to become a spy. The part where she keeps looking at the explosions behind her was really funny because JJ had to keep turning her head around.THE BAD
Bautista seems to have found his niche in Hollywood at taking characters who are large, muscle-bound, meat heads with not much going on upstairs. Alongside professional comedians like Schaal and Jeong his comedic acting can sometimes be painful to watch as he tries to compete with them for laughs but comes across more forced than natural.
And for those of you looking for an action film this is not entirely the case with My Spy. Although it is bookended with big, action, set pieces it is more a romantic comedy as much of the film is taken up with telling the story of JJ's budding friendship with Sophie and finding a possible love interest with her mum, Kate.Mr. 9: It got really boring in the middle because there was no action happening. The bad guy was there at the start and then disappeared until the end of the film. It seemed different from what the trailer showed.THE UGLY
For those of you who are familiar with Dave Bautista you would know that he is bald up top. Yet for some unknown reason the hair and makeup team decided to either spray paint or put a toupee on top of his head which is jet black and extremely short. It looks so unnatural and left me staring at the top of his head for most of the movie. Somewhat in shock and somewhat in fascination I couldn't stop looking at this unusual follicle choice.I didn't have high hopes for My Spy after seeing the trailer but walked out pleasantly surprised at how a completely unoriginal film could be so enjoyable. Bautista's charm and Coleman's likeability really carry this film above 'just another comedy'. An enjoyable film to finish off the school holidays!THREE AND A HALF TOUPEES OUT OF FIVEMr. 9: All the spy stuff was fun and the movie was also pretty funny although it had a lot of swearing for a 'PG' film.

One thing that got tired quickly was the stereotypical notion that men cheat. Every 5 minutes, we are reminded that men cheat. They have no choice. This is a lie that keeps being told over and over. Today one is not supposed to stereotype any group, but apparently it is still ok to stereotype men. The truth is that just as many married women cheat as much as men, if not more, and studies reflect this.

The drama part of the movie also sucked, it leads you to believe the husband is cheating on his wife, and then you find out he isn't, but they never explained why on one night that started all her doubts he went from seemingly wanting to make passionate love with her to suddenly losing interest in her at all.
At a minimum, at the end, when she was becoming convinced he had not cheated, SHE SHOULD HAVE ASKED WHAT HAPPENED THAT NIGHT! I still want to know the answer and feel the movie did NOT realize a good conclusion that was convincing as to why he acted that way on that night. I'm still left with the unfulfilled feeling that maybe he was cheating and got away with it because he just happened to come home early from one business trip!Also, the drama wasn't very good at the drama part, the interactions with the kids were Boring, and Bill Murray cracked a few laughs at his sexist stupidity and moronic comments about how all men are hardwired to cheat, but it was a talking role, he never had to actually act and or change his facial expressions!",On the Rocks,2020-10-23,6.5,23462,2020

At least they had a nice screen chemistry and share couple of nice moments together.Sadly I can't say the same about the couple.

tt9606374,2,"From all low reviews, none of them mentioned the fact that Apple produced this movie, which I think is pretty essential for the poor quality it has resulted in. Why would a large electronics company be the blame? Exactly. Because they have more to lose than to gain. In my opinion, this causes a narrow-minded, unrealistic portrayel that comes nowhere near real-world drama that they try to convey. There is no risk, no edge, no emotional message. If there are any messages, they smell pretentious and out of date. For some reason they like to think they created some legitimate cause for spreading cliches about pretty much any topic they choose and reformatting them using their own narrow-minded, conservative style they would use for an Apple ad. Multi-racial relationship without any real difficulties or emotional depth, new york coffee cups and big appartments, creating start-ups, writing books and raising children (or rather have baby sitters), all pretty much stress free. Where is that crucial moment that shows that they actually care for people and have looked into the ways people behave and interact with one another in the real world. A world that is dominated by much larger and more important things than silly relational misunderstandings with happy endings? One might wonder: why would you put that much thought in just another romantic comedy (if you can call it that)? Well, it's because it's movies like these that send out the wrong morals and values in a way that simply does not comply with today's expectations and ideals. It does the complete opposite of what feel-good movies should deliver in times like these.

tt11057644,3,"I rewatched the first film right after finishing this, because I had forgotten what I even liked to begin with that was missing here... turns out it was a lot. Firstly, the main character is gone, Teddy (Judah Lewis)... but he's the lucky one because those who are present are all only half-there. There's no family thread, except one that gets sloppily bookended to the beginning and end with the care of a 90's sitcom (essentially a Full House subplot quality, teen girl temper tantrum). The first film they were dealing with a recent death, a cynical world, the son slipping into a realistic life of crime. Where do we start out here? On vacation??? Yes, their first world problem is that Kate (Darby Camp) is upset her mom is dating an awesome guy. I say problem, but this isn't really dealt with as she immediately gets away from the entire cast of her family to have a separate adventure hanging out with Santa (Kurt Russell) and wife (Goldie Hawn) in a bland mess of cliches that only a very young child will like (it does have bright colors flashing).The rest of the film is a sloppy CGI romp through the North Pole, feeling much like the mess of Santa Clause 2 & 3, super villain and all. We're told the title Christmas Chronicles is no longer their video camera footage (as video camera films are no longer popular) but a series of novels (no doubt to establish a possible franchise and bunch of sequels). The film isn't set in a realistic nowadays world, but 100% in a fantasy, so essentially a totally different type a film and NOT a continuation of the first film. This would be like Christmas Vacation being set entirely in Clark Griswald's sex dream and acting like it's a sequel. It makes no sense. The elves are more like Gremlins (thank you Chris Columbus, just make Gremlins 3 already) than the edgy but sweet creatures from the first, with a goofy drug Elf-bane explanation of why they are snarling.A bland villain pulls the plot along screaming all the way, instead of the protagonists (which should lead it). Their only motivation is to stop the bad guy, whose motivation is to stop the good guy. That's it. Spy vs spy. That's the movie. Absent are the bystander characters that made the first film fun, the cops, the waitress at the restaurant, the guy who stole the car first, the people in jail. We don't get any characters to really see their transformation due to their seeing Santa is real, ya know the magic of the first film. Santa is still cool, but without his sarcastic edge, snappy lines. In short, the fun is totally gone. It's got 10x the effects and none of the heart or story-building that made the original worth watching over and over. Terrible. Absolutely inexcusable.

I remember old Nick/Disney live action shows that had better acting/script.The story in general was just too predictable and, well, modern. Typical villain with angry personal issues trying to steal Christmas... wait, that sounds familiar... Anyway, very poor acting with him, severe lack of emotion.
Same with the kids, it all just felt so fake.I'm keeping this very brief for obvious reasons, but this movie was plagued by 2020's ""trending social issues"" and trying to be as inclusive as possible.

tt10161886,5,"The Prom is the movie adaptation of a Broadway show bearing the same name. It has an important message, and for the most part, is entertaining. And while most of the music is good, the way it translates to the silver screen is, unfortunately, quite hit or miss.Since music is what makes or breaks a musical, let's start with that. Most songs were catchy and fun, and the ones that were meant to be more emotional worked fairly well. Had that not been that case, The Prom would've been an absolute disaster. While some musicals may save the singing for the most important story points, this one used them for everything. It's song after song, and the breaks in between tend to be quite short. Some, I'm sure, will be opposed to that as is, but I didn't mind it too much. However, when the entire narrative is told through song, they need to be good. And most of them certainly are. In fact, I don't think that there was anything wrong with the songs themselves, unfortunately though, some of the performances worked well in a movie form, while others didn't.
What makes musicals on a live stage good is the sense of wonder and admiration. It's always more impressive to watch someone sing and act and dance live on stage, rather than in a movie. And on stage, even if the song itself isn't the most memorable one, the props and grandeur of the whole performance make it come to life, literally. So when you take music and performances designed for a stage and put them into a movie, they are already at a disadvantage. And while watching The Prom, it's easy to see that. However, movies do also bring their own possibilities. And it was those songs and performances, that used and benefitted from the movie format, that worked the best. While others, unfortunately, felt like cheap and lifeless copies of what they could've been on stage.The story, which introduces us to a group of dishevelled broadway actors who have lost their charm, is quite good. While the group of four actors are the main focus of the story, we also follow the life of Emma, a 17-year old girl who is trying to fight for a prom that welcomes everyone, no matter who they love. The group of actors help Emma on her journey, while learning a lot about themselves, as well. Although the story didn't offer anything new or groundbreaking, it does come with a crucially important message. The message that we should all be proud of who we are, and we should all be free to love whoever we want to. And it's that message that really carries this film.However, while the story and the musical performances were great, the movie as a whole wasn't. What baffles me the most, is how slow The Prom felt. You'd think that a movie that is basically one colourful and striking performance after another would go by in a whim. But, this one did the opposite. I checked how much there was left at least three times, and every time I was amazed by how much there was. The only reason I can come up with for its sluggish feel is an overuse of music. Since the story is quite a simple one, it could've been told much quicker in a non-musical format. While the songs and performances are fun, they also make the narrative take a lot longer. And although I did enjoy most of the songs, I guess they just lacked the effect that they would've had on stage.It's quite unfortunate that The Prom felt like it was twice as long as it actually was. Had that not been the case, I think I would've enjoyed it quite a bit more. It has a good message, as well as a good heart, and what it lacks in originality, it tries to make up for with entertaining musical numbers, and for the most part, it succeeds. While it does a lot of things right, the end product just felt underwhelming and lacked the charisma and wow factor that it would have had on a stage.",The Prom,2020-12-11,6,22539,2020

tt10161886,10,"I saw ""The Prom"" on Broadway a couple of times, and was so moved by it (as was the whole audience). I told everyone about it, bought all the merchandise, played the soundtrack over and over, etc. Point: I LOVED the Broadway version. So I was super excited to find out that Netflix was making a film version, and have been looking forward to it for a long time.I was a little hesitant when I heard about the decision to cast ""Names"" only in a show that ironically purposely cast a lot of actors who had been in small Broadway roles for years, but never the leads, until now. There are also some incredible vocal numbers that Broadway performers are trained for, and I wasn't sure that the ""Names"" could handle them (with the exception of Andrew Rannells, who became famous due to Broadway). I happy to say that I needn't have worried.All of the actors cast were incredible in their respective roles, did all of the beautiful numbers justice, and brought these characters to life. Yes, it is very campy and over the top, but that's how it was originally written (and done) for Broadway. On purpose, because, campy, flashy, etc. not only makes for a magnificent feast for the eyes (and ears), but it also makes it much easier to digest what are serious issues (Inclusion, Homophobia, Bullying, etc.), without being too preachy or angry. The film is made with the lavish style and camp magic that is a Broadway Musical and embraces that, basically, it's not made to look like a dramatic film, it's meant to look as if you were watching a Broadway show. The original Broadway choreographer, Casey Nicholaw, also choreographed the screen version as well, for example.Keegan-Michael Key actually sings a number called ""We Look To You"" whose lyrics literally explain the reason for a film like this. It's fun, it's moving, it will make you want to sing and dance along, and hopefully appreciate Broadway and Musicals more, and perhaps Celebrate people, and all of their differences as well. Meryl Streep is amazing, as are everyone in the cast. I'm seeing a lot of negativity towards James Corden in reviews, but to his credit, he plays Barry exactly as he should, and he is really heartwarming in what I feel is one of his best performances ever.Watch this film if you love musicals, dancing, big production numbers, optimistic stories with heart and tales of love, acceptance and redemption. I've already watched this film twice, and I will definitely own a copy when it becomes available.

It's one of those movies where you just have to go with the flow it is what it is. It's over the top but I think that's the point but does it work well at times it does and other times it's doesn't. The actors are underused there good but they could of been better but I'm not blaming the actors they did there best for what they got.

tt10161886,10,"This movie is genuinely so good. Ryan Murphy really delivered. There were a few things going in that I was worried about (namely James Corden playing Barry Glickman rather than Brooks Ashmanskas who absolutely amazed me in the original Broadway cast). However, Corden really delivered the heart of this character so beautifully. Now, Ashmanskas was definitely funnier and still had as much heart as Corden did, but I was in no way disappointed with Corden's performance. I, in fact, really loved it. Meryl Streep is the star of this film. Her acting, singing, and just all around charm is infectious. I could watch this movie JUST for her over and over again. Luckily, I loved the rest of the cast. Andrew Rannells, Nicole Kidman, Kerry Washington, Keegan Michael-Key, and Ariana Debose all gave such heart-felt and honest performances. I GASPED when I saw Kerry Washington's final costume of the film.There is definitely some ""cheese"" in this movie, but I expected that so I wasn't bothered. I enjoyed what was added from Broadway to Screen for the character of Barry Glickman. It is a lot of different characters to follow, but I feel they did a great job of keeping me invested in all of them throughout.

The cheese level worked live and loses its charm here and then some. I am a huge fan of movie musicals, especially ones that adapt existing Broadway shows. This movie wasted its potential to add more poignant plot elements, opting for unnecessary, less-than-charming camp and boring filler scenes. Kerry Washington is insufferable beyond what her role calls for, James Corden's portrayal of a homosexual actor is offensive, and the writing is lazy.

tt8851668,6,This film is very hit or miss. At times it can be really funny. For example one of the first scenes of the leads as a couple in their apartment is great. I think it really gets how couples are and how they argue about trivial things and they make it really funny.But the film can get bogged down by the jokes that don't land and can kinda make you cringe slightly.Issa Rea is great and probably my favourite part of the movie. Most of her lines land and don't get me wrong Kumail is really good to but some of his line do fall flat.The plot is also kinda predictable and basic but it doesn't make it any less enjoyable.I also noticed that Netflix basically did zero promotion for this movie which I found strange but Iv have kind of come to expect that from Netflix.So it's an easy watch and you'll get a few laughs I'd say give it a watch,The Lovebirds,2020-05-22,6.1,21613,2020

That they are likeable is true enough, and there are a couple of jokes in there somewhere too but the plot is weak and, for a short feature film, it dragged like hell. I thought it was about 25 minutes longer than it was.
The best bits are when they couple are just talking about their problems. They could have made a modern Before Sunrise, but instead they made a bellow average murder mystery.

Same blackmailing scheme, same cop involvement, same climax at the waterfront, same kind black woman cop who knows they're not involved. I love the actors, and a couple of their remarks are funny, but if this HAD been released in theaters, it would have bombed the first weekend, and we'd never hear of it again.

tt8851668,4,"This film has a solid critic score. But it has a poor audience score, both on RT and on here. If you read the reviews on RT, you'll notice that most of the positive ones come from critics who are recommending it solely because they like the leads. I think the two leads are both very talented, but I don't agree with the critics who are doing this. This is a bad film, whether you like the leads or not.It has become rather common for critics to disregard significant flaws and still recommend a film essentially just because it promotes diversity or another form of political correctness, which I find to be pandering and problematic. This film was suppose to get a wide theatrical release and I'm glad major studios have begun picking up more films with diverse leads, but that isn't a good reason to recommend it if it isn't otherwise well-made. Those films still should be analyzed just like any other and the leads not being white shouldn't cause it to receive bonus points that ultimately nudge it positive, when the review would otherwise be ultimately negative.I like the leads, but their presence wasn't enough to compensate for the fact that there's nothing else here. The murder mystery aspect and overall story felt very carelessly written (especially its conclusion), and there's nothing clever about the sequence of events that the characters go through. There also isn't much characterization. The film relies completely on the leads and them being funny, and although they're likable, it features scattered small laughs at best.I'm usually not against films being shorter, but the beginning felt very rushed. The characters and their relationship could have used a lot more development before throwing them into the murder mystery. Ultimately clocking out at not even an hour and a half, the film abruptly ends with you feeling like nothing memorable ever happened.I also really didn't appreciate the multiple times that characters were called rapists solely due to being in a fraternity. Not everyone in a frat is a rapist and films shouldn't make jokes that reinforce that assumption.",The Lovebirds,2020-05-22,6.1,21613,2020

The problem being that in a film that's supposed to be about two people who were once in love, now aren't, who attempt to get back their chemistry while dealing with extraordinary circumstances, is that there is non-existent chemistry between the leads. There is no way you'd convince me these two would ever fall in love, let alone fall out of it. Even when there's ""romance"" between them, it's laughably unbelievable. Don't casting directors vet for ANY sense of chemistry between the leads anymore before they are cast?
The answer to this is obviously ""no"", as both actors saw easy money and their agents said yes, chemistry be damned.
Another minor complaint, since I saw him in ""The Big Sick"" (wildly better film btw, and the characters actually have chemistry!!), I've found Kumail to be an extremely likable actor, unfortunately he seems to have the Adam Sandler bug of just saying ""yes"" to any film he's offered, because I've noticed as of late he's in one terrible film after another, that's obviously just a paycheck to him. This film seems to be yet another cash-in for all parties involved.
Overall, it's a strictly by-the-numbers plot line with zero chemistry between the leads. Skip it unless nothing else is available.",The Lovebirds,2020-05-22,6.1,21613,2020
tt8851668,2,"We had high hopes for this - the preview looked promising. I think it's supposed to be a comedy, but it's just not funny. There is no chemistry between the two leads. They might be goood actors, but this is not the vehicle of either of them. They just weren't good in it, but really, no one was. Calling the ""frat boy"" Brett Cavanagh was a cheap shot.

They throw in way to much Hollywood wannabe actioncrap, try way to hard to include every genre into one, to pretend this is something else then it should be.I really loved Train to Busan, it was an awesome and unique Zombie flick with high quality. Emotional ride with fear, stress and good story. Was glued on the monitor whole movie through, it was that good. Korea really made a classic with that one.This is the complete opposite. Its plain stupid. Zombies seems pretty harmless cgi placeholders only meant to fly in the air and get hit by cars. U never feel any kind of fear och horror in this movie, its just dumb action with stupid lines. Story is crap, writing is crap, very low character development, plotholes, timejumps, stupid characters, actors who overact and make a fool out of themself.If you take Transformers, mix it with Zombieland on drugs, add Fast and the furious... ehm... and then add World War Z cgi zombies on a budget then u get this. But worse then all those movies ofcourse.The carchases are computer generated, and it looks like a PC-game. Also most of the Zombies are just cgi, ragdolls flying all over...and it really shows its fake. Its World War Z style, but cheaper ripoff. When the end comes closer, they even try to switch the pace from rollercoaster action to emotional cry drama and it just falls flat like a pancake... u end up laughing cause its so silly.Plus, the plot armour on the soldier is of epic proportions, he cant miss, hits only headshots, zombies throw themself on him, but he got his anti-bite armor on so they cant touch him, he got time to think a few seconds now and then, even if he is surrounded by soldiers or zombies on every direction... cause they wont do anything to him while he feels sad.... boohoo....Stay away from this at cinema, its not worth the money.

It's almost cruel how much the film tugged at your heartstrings.Train to Busan wastes no time getting to the point, the build up only takes a few brief scenes, then the madness captivates the rest. We see the outbreak from beginning, middle and end within the narrative's run time. You have time to develop empathy for each character, their backstories, and connections to one another fleshed out in small bursts throughout the film. While the human condition is in question, the narrative also explores societal themes, which are all perfectly juxtaposed with gory yet skillfully crafted action sequences.This movie on the other hand may as well be directed by Michael Bay with pointless action and explosions. It tries too hard to be like Hollywood action movies and it shows. I will pretend this movie never happened.",Train to Busan Presents: Peninsula,2020-08-07,5.5,21308,2020
tt8850222,3,Just saying.. There is no train in this movie at all just a lot of cars..its not a sequel to the first movie just using the same pandemic that's started in Korea...This movie has a very different vibe from the first movie... it is not really a survival zombie movie like the first one..no really thrilling zombie scene compared to the first one.. more to war between humans with car racing and guns..There are some questionable facts in this movie such as a mother who let her kids riding cars like that ..and a really young girl who can drive like that is too good to be true.. a group of people survived that long but did not in anyway try to contact the outside world? But instead capture people and have fun watching them being killed by zombies..Did not really feel anything when some of the characters died.. There are some forced drama like the death of his brother in law which I don't really care.. Because not much bond can be felt between them..

But I expected too much because you know, 4 years from Train to Busan!I suggest that if you don't want anything to do with the first movie and want some human to human plot with zombies on the side then you can probably sit through this movie. I just lingered on hoping something interesting will happen but the whole miserable 2 hours just failed me. Really disappointed and sad that they weren't able to live up to the first movie. I hope we can all just pretend this movie never happened and wish they will make a part 3 which is more connected or has the feels of the first one.

If you watched the trailer it includes mainly the only 2 scenes in this film in which it includes some horror ""concept"", the stairs full of zombies scenes and the pile of zombies. Unfortunately these 2 scenes are almost glimpses in the film and awfully misused.Most of the zombie scenes are distant cheap CGI that are a disaster and easily spotted not to mention the laughable CGI Car chases. The very few real zombies scenes, we only get to witness a highly athletic and gymnastic type of zombie! Where's the down size in being infected?! You run super fast, You Jump like a cheetah and you can even dodge bullets!!! WTF!On a different note, the characters are far from being interesting, the writer in a sad attempt tries to literally ""shove"" huge load of emotions at the end of the film yet fails miserably as we already fail to care about any of the stereotypical characters to begin with.And finally we are faced with a cliched predictable Hollywood ending of a low budget movie level.Viewers should know that Peninsula is an Action, Thriller film at best not a Horror in anyway, I believe they should've quit while they were ahead in Train to Busan but the cash grabber is a world wide disease.",Train to Busan Presents: Peninsula,2020-08-07,5.5,21308,2020

The story takes place four years after the events of part one. A guilt ridden Korean soldier now living as a refugee in Hongkong is sent along with four fellas to retrieve a truck full of money from the quarantined Korea now inhabited by zombies.
Comparison to Mad Max, Doomsday, Fast n Furious will crop up everywhere. But the point is, is it entertaining? O yeah! Tons of car chase n gun action sequences. Fans of Train to Busan like me will b disappointed.
The social commentary, the emotions, the characters n most importantly the zombie stuff is missing here.
The climax scene in slow mo with melodrama gets on ur nerves. Watch out for the UN's major Jane. Her dialogue delivery n the way she runs is hilarious.

It felt like a cash grab attempt on the citizens of the countries where the theatres are open.I still cannot believe the movie has 6/10 in IMDB.

tt8850222,5,"When Train to Busan hit theaters, it became a sensational hit for the right reasons. It manages to become an enjoyable blockbuster yet with smart social commentary and emotional moments that (I need to admit) made me cry. 4 years later, Peninsula - the sequel - hit the theaters with high ambition but fail to reach the height of its predecessor as it falls into the ordinary sequel trap.4 years after the events of Train to Busan, a former marine, Jung-Seok (Gang Dong-won) must return and retrieve something at now-abandoned Korea in order to be accepted by the society outside their homeland. I really appreciate how they took a new approach to the zombie sequels with a new setting. However, bigger doesn't always mean better as the world-building lacked in the concept details of that never reach the tension felt in its predecessor.Perhaps the above reason can't be blame due to its small yet important component: characters. A large number of characters also resulted in less screen-time, making it hard to have in-depth sympathy with the characters. The characters also felt flat with its two-dimensional personality, making it hard for the characters to be likable even when the actors have given their best to portray them. As a result, it lacks emotional attachment and even scares to deliver.Still, I can't deny on how much entertaining Peninsula has to offer. Yeon Sang-ho's use of camerawork and how he directs the action sequence make the film watchable. I preferably like the first chase scene with zombies and the survival game. The survival game especially, really showcases his direction with his one-take. The visual style could be deemed as unique as well, showing abandoned Korea as dirty and chaotic yet beautifully eye-catching. Although I need to say that the CG in its car scene is extremely rough that you somehow looking more of a video game than a live-action film.Overall, Peninsula is could never reach its predecessor quality as a smart blockbuster with a high emotional level. However, its entertainment value, if almost, could still reach what it had left 4 years ago. Just don't expect too much to use your brain and have fun as you visit Peninsula.",Train to Busan Presents: Peninsula,2020-08-07,5.5,21308,2020

tt8850222,1,"Allowing this movie to air on the big screen, is an outright insult to the viewers. This is a half-assed, textbook case of milking a successful movie (Train to Busan) into a poor ""sequel"".I can write a book about the plot holes, inconsistensies and the movies being impossible for the viewers to suspend their disbelief to take it seriously.There are extended segments of painfuly edgy teen/toddler duo. Where they exchange one liners and run over infected in a ""stylish"" way. All the while they slam into other cars while drifting and grind against building/cars anime style. All the while, without sustaining as much as a scratch to the car's paint, and not even a splash of blood...Even better, nearly 1/4th of the movie is composed of these EXTREMELY poorly made CGI sections and car chases (yay?). For some reason these scenes dominate the majority of the movie.This is all so (masterfully ?) Integrated with an overwhelming amount of EXTENDED ""sad"" slow motion shots of ""dramatic"" situation about underdeveloped characters that you couldn't care less about, dying or ""almost"" dying but being saved at the last second. Rambo-style by the invincible main protagonist.This movie is utter trash, unbelievably so. I can't recall the last time where i had such an overwhelming urge, to storm out of the theater, and demand a refund.Do your a huge favour and dodge this bullet that i took for you. AVOID THIS MOVIE.

tt8850222,6,"Peninsula is an extremely fun movie to watch. It packs virtually all genres possible, the movie is way too much but very entertaining. You have zombies (although they are not really threatening and felt more like a tool used to advance the plot), you have Mad Max-like car chases, you have wild insane people enjoying the Purge, you have a hint of a comedy and a whole lot of soap opera drama. At one point I was convinced the characters would start dancing Bollywood-style!
While Train to Busan was character-driven and emotional film, Peninsula is a wild, action-packed movie which has almost nothing to do with the former. It would fit perfectly into Zombieland universe and the reviews here would be much better then. In other words, it is a bad movie if you expect Train to Busan continuation but a good Zombieland 3.
Plot-wise, Peninsula leaves even more question unanswered, if you think about characters' background or some story details you'll notice a lot of inconsistencies, plot holes and unclarities. But this movie is not made to think, so don't take it seriously, don't expect much and just enjoy whatever nonsense is going on on-screen.",Train to Busan Presents: Peninsula,2020-08-07,5.5,21308,2020

tt8850222,6,"I was one of three patrons of a local theatre showing this film, which opened yesterday, Friday, August 7.
Plot wise the story contunues to highlight family, in this instance a captain and the brother in law he is estranged from, and a second anchored by an aging grandfather who could easily been dismissed as senile, his very strong daughter and her two girls.
Throw in HK gangsters and a dishounored former military unit doing its best to survive in Inchon.
Shake and stir.
The action is non stop, which actually distracts from the adversaries' character development and any actual suspense or mystery.
Everyone is too well armed, quite the contrary to TRAIN TO BUSAN which was pared down to just the necessary.
Its characters served a purpose that propellled the story along, and those characters were of interest, so their demise was felt.

tt8850222,7,"This movie will mess with you a bit, especially if you've seen Train to Busan.At first, it seems a strong start but it doesn't take long for it to become something akin to Mad Max: Zombie Edition. This feels out of place considering how serious the first movie was. The action during this part is good and the Korean wasteland looks excellent. If you've played The Last of Us video game then you'll probably think they took inspiration from it, like I did, in terms of the visual style. But, the horror and emotion is kind of missing during this section of the movie and, as a typical Zombie movie trope, humans become the real enemy for a while. That's so cliche that I'm fed up of seeing it now. This part of the movie isn't 'bad', it's just probably not what you signed up for. It's still entertaining but in a different kind of way.The ending is the real star of the whole movie though. They seem to throw all the emotion that the movie was lacking at you all at once.

tt5918982,NA,"In this film, set in the near future, brain implant technology allows one person to inhabit the mind, body, and spirit of another. A clandestine corporation uses this technology to assassinate wealthy and powerful people for profit. The film explores what happens when the host starts to fight to regain control from a guest who is not entirely mentally stable, to begin with.Interesting enough premise. The film is set in a very bleak version of the future where cities appear to be sparsely populated (perhaps from some event that greatly reduced the population such as plague or war; a motif borrowed from Argento's Tenebre). The film relies heavily on psychotropic imagery, and this adds to the overall frightening and confusing atmosphere since most of this imagery is nightmarish (distorted faces reminiscent of David Cronenberg's The Brood, warped colors, bursts of sound and images, blurs, rapid-fire images and strobing flashes of light). The film further relies on ultra-violence as a motif that rivals even the Italian slasher films of the late 1970s and early 80s (such as Susperia, Tenembre, Opera, etc.). Possessor contains explicit sexual motifs including full male nudity and erect penises, which reminds me very much of Antichrist (2009) or The Man Who Fell to Earth (1976). These are juxtaposed with explicit imagery of knives penetrating flesh. All of this results in a nightmare landscape. The ending is purposely left confusing so that that the viewer can arrive at their own conclusions. For some viewers, this will be frustrating.All of this wraps up into a very worthwhile enough film, but for viewers with a more sophisticated palate (if you are looking for a Blumhouse type film Possessor is not what you are looking for). It is disturbing to be sure. However, it is very well made and anchored by two very outstanding performances from Andrea Riseborough and Christopher Abbott. It also features Jennifer Jason Leigh and Sean Bean in very laudable supporting roles (whether or not Sean Bean dies I will not spoil). Possessor is a ""Criterion Collection"" caliber film that will give the viewer some satisfaction analyzing and will with you long after you see it.",Possessor,2020-10-02,6.5,19855,2020

Possessor has some great performances and nice visual choices, the body horror bits do not disappoint as well and I thought the narrative was engaging from start to finish, found no issues with the pacing whatsoever.We need more creative works like this on horror-fantasy.",Possessor,2020-10-02,6.5,19855,2020
tt5918982,7,"One of the greatest directors from the 70s forward who put forth the idea of science fiction with body modification and manipulation was David Cronenberg. Imagine being the son of Cronenberg and having to live up to his record of films. It appears that his son Brandon is doing just that and succeeding. His latest film does just that and more, creating a science fiction premise that is frightening and fascinating at the same time.POSSESSOR takes place in the near future and opens with a brilliant yet violent segment that shows what the film is all about. A young woman named Holly (Gabrielle Graham) is seen inserting something into the top of her skull and reacting to the probe emotionally. Shortly after she is attending a party as one of the hostesses there when she takes a knife and kills a high profile attorney in one of the most brutal and bloody sequences seen. Afterward she points the gun in her mouth but doesn't pull the trigger. Instead she points it at the police who kill her.But it wasn't really Holly who was responsible for the brutal killing. In reality she was being manipulated by Tasya Vos (Andrea Riseborough), a professional killer who works for a company that implants her consciousness into another person using them to pull of the contract. Having done this many times this last hit proved problematic because Holly was resisting Tasya's plan to kill herself. Rather than inform her superiors Tasya keeps this to herself.Tasya takes a short time off to visit her husband Michael (Rossif Sutherland) and son Ira who she has separated with. To do so she has to prepare herself, teaching herself how to speak and interact with normal people. It seems the mechanics involved with her profession are taking their toll on her. Unable to connect as much as she'd like, she leaves early and returns for her next job.The next assignment is a top priority one. The man being targeted is the owner of a massive corporation, John Parse (Sean Bean). They've been hired by Parse's stepson Reid (Christopher Jacot) to kill both him and his daughter Ava (Tuppence Middleton) so that he can take over the company. Tasya's company wants the hit done as well so they can use the information to blackmail Reid.To put her in place Ava's boyfriend Colin Tate (Christopher Abbott) is captured and linked with Tasya. She now controls his body seeing what he sees, manipulating him when called on to do so. In the meantime her body lays in stasis back at the company's facility being monitored. But things don't go as planned. It seems that Colin keeps trying to regain control of his mind as Tasya works to continue manipulating him.Simply getting through the day becomes difficult for Colin/Tasya, at one point with him blacking out. Trying to recognize people and not making him seem different in his behavior is a struggle. All of this leads to a dinner held at John Parse' home. The question now becomes whether Tasya can control Colin long enough to pull off her mission or not and if so can she return to her own body?I wasn't sure what to expect when I began watching this film. I knew it premiered at Sundance but that doesn't always mean a movie is good. Sometimes those films can be critic darlings but audience dead weight. Fortunately that wasn't the case here. While the progress of the film is steady the pacing is a bit slower than most. It doesn't hurt the storytelling going on here but some people might not be willing to go along for the ride without that breakneck speed they're used to. That would be their loss.The story is compelling on various levels. There is Tasya who you want to understand and figure out why she does what she does. There is Colin who is fighting for his life here inside of his own skull. There is Girder (Jennifer Jason Leigh), Tasya's controller who has concerns for Tasya. There is Ava who seems the most innocent of the entire group. And there is John Parse, a jerk who at points seems worth killing. All of these characters combine to make an interesting story. And the acting on the parts of all involved make them come to life, becoming believable.I'd love to say I love the film but in all honesty I really just enjoyed it but found it not a movie I'm likely to revisit. It is worth one viewing at least and will keep you guessing. The version being released is unrated due to a combination of gore and nudity so keep that in mind. Not one for the kids. On the whole you might enjoy this one if you're a fan of sci-fi.",Possessor,2020-10-02,6.5,19855,2020
tt5918982,7,"This should be retitled,""Too Much but also not enough"". There are so many ideas pulling the movie in so many different directions. It's ideas the movie, but rarely does an idea get fully realized here. This has me torn on how I feel. On one hand, there is a unique tone to this. It's like Assassin's Creed meets inception. People possessing other people's bodies to preform hits on specific people for political or social gain is a solid premise on it's own. Throw in some great ultra violent gore effects, good performances, and some moody, atmospheric music and you get some really striking scenes. On the other hand, the movie is overly ambitious. There's so much it establishes there's no way it can accomplish it all, and it doesn't. This is exemplified in the first act which feels horribly rushed. We get less then 20 minutes establishing characters, premise, and themes. It feels like it can't wait to move through the set up and what results is a lack of investment from me. We hardly know who anyone is or why they are doing anything. The main character is having a psychological melt down as a result from over working inside this possessor machine but she only takes like a half day off to recover. Then she's right back to work. There's barely motivation for this and in her half day off all she does is sit around at home with her ex. You needed more scenes explaining to us what lead to her breaking up with him and more establishment of why she would want to go back to him. We don't know these people or their story and we leave them so quickly it's hard to care about them at all. We literally get one scene of her away from her work, and it's nothing out of the ordinary as far as normal day goes. Why is she a workaholic? Her home life seems fine to me. Why won't she tell her superiors that she's having a mental breakdown? Is it supposed to be a metaphor about her dependency on work to avoid her real life? If that's the case then why don't we get more scenes showing why she would be avoiding her life? It's a messy movie, full of vague characters and even murkier story progression. Even though the first act is rushed, at least it sets some interesting things up. The second act is where the movie really faulters though. It feels like the same scenes happening over and over again. It gets really tedious watching a character saying the possessed person is acting weird over and over. There are some cool, trippy, drug like sequences showing the main character having more internal breakdowns but I got the point after the first time. Yeah she's not stable enough to be in there and the longer she is, the worse it will get. I get it. We don't need to see it 27 times. This is weird because the first act has the exact opposite problem. Like Inception these people are trying to accomplish something by manipulating others for their gain. Unlike Inception, where the first half of the movie is establishing characters, story motivations, and potential speed bumps, Possessor only seems interested in establishing the story speed bumps. We don't get a clear sense of character motivation or why the story is happening in the first place. This possessor company wants to own this large tech company? But why? Who knows! The real story is about the Possessor and the Possessy who go to war over who should have control over the body. So why even mention that they want to absorb this tech company? Instead, say that she needs to kill these people just because they are evil or corrupt. That wouldn't change what the movie is going for and it would clean up the story a bit. The whole point is the struggle between the possessed dude and the possessor and coming to terms with the horrible things that happened. It's kinda like watching someone with split personality disorder. Which, again, is an idea that could've and should've been fleshed out. It only comes up near the end and is wrapped up so quickly I don't know why they even bothered. The first act is completely rushed, the second act is drawn out to no end, and the third act introduces more things it can't quite pull off. So...eh?*2nd viewing edition*
I liked this way more on second watch. Maybe it's the uncut version or maybe I just got it this time. The biggest theme explored is the idea that sometimes it's hard to tell who we really are. Are we so inspired by others to do things that we end up losing our sense of self? You could interpret this as a meditation on mental illness but I see it as every day life. The culture is so saturated by ""hot takes"", opinions, and people ""looking out for our best interest"" that it can truly be numbing. The disassociation we can feel could be as simple as everyday little things to life altering marriage. Who knows if we love them or if someone we love loves them for us. This is all beautifully captured and comes around full circle at the end. Again, it's possible I just didn't get it the first time around but, this uncut version somehow feels tighter. I was transfixed by it. The first act flows nicely, the second act escalates well, and the climax is thoroughly satisfying. Man, I think I feel a third viewing coming...",Possessor,2020-10-02,6.5,19855,2020
tt5918982,8,"Ok, i don't usually write reviews here, although I am an avid movie fanatic.To be frank i wasn't familiar with Brandon Cronenberg and his work up until now, and I must say this is a treat for the fans of his Dad's work.The beginning is kind of meh I admit and nothing special but from the mid point towards the end it keeps getting better and better and the main thing is the beautiful atmosphere and cinematography and visuals and practical effects in the style of 80s masterpieces of his famous father.This is by far the most interesting movie in this ""subgenre"" of horror in years and maybe even from the 80s/90s and since David shifted more towards the ""mainstream"" if that is something you can ever say about David Cronenberg.Also the acting is great as is the casting. The colors and the mood of the film are really on point. Shot out to Director of photography.To top it all of the ""ending theme"" or ""possessor"" as it is credited in the soundtrack by Jim Williams is nothing short of a masterpiece.If you loved David Cronenberg's ""Videodrome"" or ""The Scanners"" or even ""Dead Ringers"" you will surely appreciate this one..Do not be thrown away by the bad reviews and take a look for yourself!",Possessor,2020-10-02,6.5,19855,2020
tt5918982,8,"Possessor reminds me of an ultra-violent combination of Inception and Looper.It's about an assassin who uses body-hoping technology to kill her targets before terminating the body she's co-opted.The movie does not do a lot of explaining, we open up with an assassination in a swanky hotel where one of the staff is manipulated to kill a guest before security guards gun her down.Then we see the protagonist (I use the word loosely) Taysa Vos, played by Andrea Riseborough, was controlling the body of the killer from a safe distance. Vos works for a secretive company that offers these kind of closed-loop assassinations. Side bar: Taysa Vos sounds like it could be a name from the Star Wars universe, or is it just me?The process of changing bodies seems to take away from her sense of self. She takes a test after each job where she recognizes objects from her past and identifies the one that doesn't belong. When she visits her family, she has to practice sounding like herself -- as if she's rehearsing lines.What follows is a kaleidoscope of violence and surreal, dreamy imagery filmed in a cold, deliberate style. Lots of indie movies today go for this kind of neon/midnight movie mixed with Kubrick aesthetic, but Possessor pulls it off better than most.Vos is supposed to possess the body of Colin Tate (Christopher Abbott) to murder his girlfriend and her CEO father (Sean Bean) before offing himself to tie up the loose end.It goes wrong, but not in the way I expected. I'd recommend this to people who enjoy mindbenders along the lines of Primer, Triangle, or Upstream Color and can put up with a bit of seize-in-your-seat gore.",Possessor,2020-10-02,6.5,19855,2020

The uncut is a sci-fi/horror, beautifully crafted tour-de-force of complexity, graphic violence and gore that will test your will and perhaps bend the mind enough to actually get, not only the premise, but at the end of the final act, you feel somewhat rattled and an odd sense of the films relevance, not unlike his fathers filmography.Niche genre, much aligned with Alex Garland in concept, and his fathers stylistic vision and fingerprints are on it, but this is Brandon's baby, and what a baby he has conceived.",Possessor,2020-10-02,6.5,19855,2020

I am extremely glad that I did. I read a bunch of the reviews on here and people seem torn in a lot of directions as far as what happened and what should be interpreted as what in this movie and none of them are exactly like my take on the story. I simply love films that have the ability to do this. I feel a lot of similarity between this film and David Lynch's Daughter's film Surveilance. Both offspring seemed to have been able to capture part of the essence of what make their parent's films so wonderful while still putting their own little twist of flavor in there. I cant wait to see what both of them do next but I am extremely relieved that someone is carrying on the torch for these types of cerebraly challenging films.",Possessor,2020-10-02,6.5,19855,2020

tt5918982,7,"Immensely disturbing, shocking and provocative; ""Possessor"" takes you on a wild ride while playing with your mind.In this science-fiction horror film, an agent working for a secretive organization uses brain-implant technology to inhabit other people's bodies, driving them to commit assassinations for high-paying clients.It goes without saying that Cronenberg is heavily influenced by the earlier films his father made but I also couldn't help but think of John Frankenheimer's ""Seconds""while watching this. You can see where Cronenberg wants to play with sci-fi, horror and even reality. It's a daring vision and one you won't soon forget (if you have the stomach for it). Christopher Abbott is haunting in the lead role and Andrea Riseborough delivers a solidly chilling performance. It's a scary-ass film and I'm telling you there are visuals in ""Possessor"" that will haunt you for days, but I recommend you see it.Follow @snobmedia for all reviews!",Possessor,2020-10-02,6.5,19855,2020

I simply detest slow panning shots with ambient music. It was an extremely drawn out affair, interjected with frantic disjointed scenes of of graphic violence and sex. I feel this movie was made more for the filmaker's entertainment than the audience. It could have ended (and really should have) twenty minutes sooner. Even though it was about 90 minutes, it felt so much longer to me. The ending was a mess but at that stage I was just happy it was over.",Possessor,2020-10-02,6.5,19855,2020
tt5918982,3,"This movie is unsettling. To its credit, that is partially due to its commitment to the relentlessly bleak and bloody life of Tasya, a woman whose job is to use a strange machine that lets her inhabit other people's bodies to carry out violent assassinations. The film truly conveys the dread of an alternate universe where such a thing exists. The audience is in a strange position at the edge of the seat waiting to see how this woman and her overlords' missions go, yet also wondering if we should be hoping for their own demise given the immorality of their scheme. It doesn't help that Tasya herself seems perturbed about her own actions.Unfortunately, the film is also unsettling for a number of negative reasons. Firstly, it is grotesque. It features ridiculously gory violence and pornographic imagery, including a scene where a child is shot and killed and highly explicit sex scenes. These kinds of elements can be appropriate when crafting a film, but the creators of this film are highly egotistical to think that they have the skill to use these elements as anything more than shock value.Secondly, the actual writing of the film is lazy. It is premised on a fascinating science-fiction concept of using technology to control other people and have them carry out violence for you, but that is the only substance to the film. None of the people in the film seem like living humans; they are just there to either kill or be killed. There is no way to connect with or care about anyone in the film, except when you feel sorry for them being brutalized so viciously or wish they would stop committing such heinous acts. Very few things are justified in the movie. Why, in a world that mostly seems to be just like our own, do they have this incredible ability for one person to take control of another's body? Who exactly is doing this? How would this be worth it, given the monetary, legal, and ethical liabilities? Why would anyone agree to do this? Why does no one notice? Why are the victims left alone so much, without anyone there to help them? This mystifying world is actually just an empty world, like a notepad with only two pages of notes and the rest is blank.Finally, the movie veers into government-granted film student cheese. While it is stylisticly interesting in some ways, it also features a constant soundtrack of grating royalty-free ""creepy"" music and features a lot of ""eerie"" filler footage. At the supposed climax, it devolves to the point of plopping loud, scary sounds onto otherwise laughable scenes with melting masks and spooky scenes flashing by.Possessor is highly dedicated to some sort of goal to unsettle us. Unfortunately, it just isn't clear what the purpose is, and therefor it is not justified in being so grotesque and unenjoyable. It joins a growing legacy of films which collect grants from multiple countries, go to print, and then get tossed in the rubbish cause no one cares.",Possessor,2020-10-02,6.5,19855,2020

What happens when the process goes smoothly, considering we are only shown what happens when the process goes haywire? I could go on....This movie feels unfinished (maybe it is?).

tt5918982,2,"Look, I'm not some prestigious movie reviewer for any magazine or website that claims to be the end all be all of cinematic opinions. All I can say is that I've seen a lot of movies and I can tell the difference between a good one and a bad one. This movie is a bad one.I might as well start with the good things this movie was able to accomplish, as there are a few. The special effects were awesome, truly something to marvel as everything felt pretty real and accurate when it comes to gore. It was visually striking and was shot pretty well. The acting was pretty decent as well for the most part. Christopher Abbott is a very skilled actor and is shows in this movie, I would argue he was the saving grace since the rest of the cast was nothing to write home about.The rest of the movie can only be described as murder porn mixed with actual porn lightly topped with a plot that remained largely unexplored. The sex scene make up probably about a third of this movie and is purely tasteless and leads to absolutely nothing. Usually sex scenes lead to character building or progression of the plot, which is not the case for this movie as it seems they're only present to please the director and a few creeps that watched this alone in the theatre. There are a few scenes in this movie that are just literal porn. I cannot stress this enough, its just porn.There's also a ton of unnecessary gore scenes that only serve to shock people into reaction because the writing failed to do so on its own. The main character appears to not enjoy killing people in this movie (which makes sense and can lead to a thicker and richer plot) yet for some reason always chooses the most traumatic and barbaric ways to kill people. It makes no sense and is never explained. She has PTSD and hates killing people, she also has a gun to kill people quickly... lets just have her kill him with a fireplace poker in the most gruesome Evil Dead way possible. This movie is not Evil Dead, it wants to take itself so seriously and yet it seems as though the director reached peak creative maturity in middle school and wrote the movie strictly for those who carry the same mentality. The ending was pure confusion and its clear the director had no clue how to end his own movie.This movie has great scores across the board. I truly for the life of me cannot understand why. Its clear that movies have had a strict decline in quality over the past few years, yet movies like these still get great reviews. Its like solid writing and interesting, well explored plots has been replaced with relentless confusion and overly ridiculous concepts yet somehow people are receptive of this. Movies are dying and were just letting it happen.",Possessor,2020-10-02,6.5,19855,2020
tt5918982,7,"Greetings from Lithuania.I mainly saw ""Possessor"" (2020) because in its genre description it is said ""Horror"", and horror being my favorite genre i picked it up. After seeing ""Possessor"" (2020) i can safely say that it is not a horror movie, not a conventional at least. ""Possessor"" is a very bloody, goory movie story and concept of which more then once reminded me of ""Inception"" - but only on a concept level, because later movie is a masterpiece and ""Possessor"" was just OK. I also liked that it was unpredictable later in a story. Where this movie did suffer was its storytelling i think - i did get the plot but it could have been told say much more involving.Overall, the director and writer Brandon Cronenberg clearly took some inspiration from ""Inception"" and from works of his famous father David Cronenberg (sudden and bloody violence) made a not bad movie overall. I liked of unpredictable it was and somehow bold, cold and bleak - but it a good way. ""Possessor"" is not the best movie around, but it was not bad either.",Possessor,2020-10-02,6.5,19855,2020

tt5918982,10,"First thing: when you are the son of Canada's most famous director, you get compared to him - unfortunately. There is no indication that Brandon Cronenberg ever benefitted from nepotism however. He created his own path from what I read in his bio. That said, I'm sure he loves and admires his father. And no doubt, the feeling is reciprocal.
Now, this movie. Wow! I'm not even going to touch on the plot. However, it is the most original and best looking movie that I have seen in years, and the music makes it even more atmospheric in key scenes. If I was a filmmaker, this is the movie that I would strive to make.
There is not a weak point in it. And it all comes from the writer-director himself. I suggest not trying to over-analyze the story and figure out every detail of the plot and characters, this movie is best absorbed intuitively. As they say: analysis kills the artist.
One last note though - there IS an interesting David C. connection: the 1999 film of his, Existenz, also starred Jennifer Jason Leigh, as a character named Geller (here in Possessor, she is Girder). Leigh was also in the recent movie Annihilation where she had a similar role, and that film is one of the closer ones in comparison to what we see happening here, though I did not like the movie Annihilation much, since the book was far superior, but that was not really the fault of director Garland who only had the first part of the Southern Reach Trilogy to work from.
As you can see, I rate this 10/10. While it is certainly not for everyone, for those attuned to such dynamic wavelengths it is a special treat.",Possessor,2020-10-02,6.5,19855,2020

Directed by Brandon Cronenberg, he certainly is a chip off the old block (David). I have to admit that the plot is not always to follow, I am sure that repeat viewings would help make things clearer (alternatively read a full synopsis). The violence and gore is extreme, plus there are a few scenes of very strong sex and nudity. The sets and locations look good and the acting is excellent.

tt10362466,4,"Okay so during the movie I was baffled by how overdramatic Tessa, Hardin and the girl with the purple hair were acting. It didn't seem like real people to me until I realised that yes, sometimes young immature people behave and talk like that (I'm 23). They scream and make assumptions and have trust issues. They are egotistic, overly jealous and completely ridiculous in how they act in their relationships. I mean they truly think that this is what real love is and feels like. If your significant other isn't toxic and doesn't make you cry 80% of the time then are you even in love?
And then one day you grow up and realise that true love makes you calm, and happy, and it makes you feel safe and understood. You never search for the knife in your back because it's not there. Sometimes real relationships are so good they get boring and that's okay. Of course there are always hardships but they don't look remotely like the ones in this movie.
Let me be clear. HARDIN AND TESSA SHOULD NOT BE TOGETHER. At least not at this part of their lives. They are both very immature and toxic to each other. The trust is not there and they keep hurting each other. They retaliate and purposely try to hurt one another. I hope young people seeing this don't mistaken this for what it isn't. On the other hand who hasn't made mistakes regarding their love life. So I guess at the end of the day you should do you.
Moving forward to the actual movie.. it's even worse. The dialogues, man, the dialogues. The direction makes me want to cry(not in a good way). I really think that many problems with the movie had to do with the problematic writing state that the books are in. Bad material can only get better to a certain point.

tt10362466,2,"There are so many things wrong in this movie. I'm upset with how it turned out. Hardin is problematic, chaotic, and so toxic. He had no character development, other than the same cycle of being ""hot"", to fighting someone, to throwing stuff, to forgetting anything happened. Where's Tessa's independence? Where's the female empowerment? Where's the individuality? It's almost as if she has nothing to her other than being with Hardin. She even works in publishing, reading, and writing, and they STILL couldn't give her ANY independence and personality? This movie poorly represented diversity. I saw no plot other than s*x, and swearing. There was a bit of sl*t shaming in there, along with Hardin having s*x with Tessa TWICE while she's under the influence of alcohol. Even if she said yes while she was drunk, it doesn't follow the guidelines for consent. If you give full consent to s*x, YOU CANNOT BE DRUNK! Their relationship hadn't changed at all from the first movie. It's a shame people will see this movie, and begin to romanticize a relationship like the one Tessa and Hardin has. Although, because of the toxicity, I'm not sure I can even say they had a relationship, due to the horrible lack of communication. Please stop giving the antagonist, assumably Molly, nothing but the title of a ""mean girl."" I get it, she's the villain. But sl*t shaming her, calling her a wh*re, and giving her no personality is boring, classic, and cliché. Oh, and I'd appreciate it if you would NOT romanticize and glorify using alcohol as a coping mechanism, along with destroying physical objects, therefore worsening the love interest, and their relationship with the main character.Oh, but it's ok, we can continue to pretend it's okay to do the following things I've just listed, because we like to ignore those points, do we?It's not a good movie, just don't waste your time on it.",After We Collided,2020-10-23,5,19787,2020

tt10003008,4,"The Rental is a new horror thriller directed, written and produced by Dave Franco. This is the first film he has directed and he is more known as an actor in the film world.In the film, brothers Charlie (Dan Stevens) and Josh (Jeremy Allen White) decide to go on a weekend trip with their friends. They have found a perfect house online by the sea and are trying to make it a pleasant weekend. They only suspect that their landlord is somewhat racist towards Josh his Muslim girlfriend Mina (Sheila Vand). Despite this mistrust, the four try to make it a fun weekend, but during this time together they get to know each other better than they expected. This is how their mutual relationships are tested. When Charlie discovers they've been secretly filmed all weekend, he must choose to find the hidden footage or confess what he secretly did over the weekend.Dave Franco has portrayed this film as his first directed film, but he has also taken on a bit too much hay by partly writing and producing this film. By taking on all these different tasks, he still struggles to convey the film clearly. At one point, the movie almost comes across as a long episode of Temptation Island and turns more into a teen drama than a horror thriller. This aspect comes to the fore without further explanation. Due to these unclear and sudden changes of genre, the film can come across as tedious.The acting comes across as nice, but due to the unclear script, the cast doesn't really have many chances to make something special out of their roles.

That's what happened here; the production team assembled a detailed accounting of the lives of a family that experienced an unspeakable tragedy. By the end of the film you have a sense that you know these people, which is also part of the problem: the more you find yourself caring, the harder it will be to keep watching.I really struggled with the foregone conclusion that was the lives of this family. Some things are so horrible my brain just doesn't want to accept them. I watched the movie in fits, drawn on by morbid curiosity but forced to continuously stop by some childish part of my brain that believed that if I simply stopped watching then somehow the remaining unseen events of the film would be trapped in a time bubble that couldn't proceed until I did. If only life worked that way. I never did make it to the very end of the movie because I just never want to hear the full detail of certain events.The movie is well made, but painful to watch. I'll admit to a certain amount of tears, and a sincere wish that I'd never heard of the Watts family. I will never understand why certain people fought to remove the application of the death penalty; if I had those memories floating around my skull, I would think death would be my best friend.

It is all recorded at the time of occurrence. The film opens with the mother arriving home as captured their home security. Then it jumps to a friend trying to locate the mother. This I believe is capture at first on someone's cell phone and then on the body cam of the office who responds. There are recorded phone messages and texts. Videos of police interviews. The mother apparently posted her entire life on social media from her lupus story to her pregnancy announcement and the father's reaction. This is such an achievement in film making, its stunning. However, when you don't have any interviews to fill the backstory, the entire situation seems flat and without depth. The film gives you the barest of hints of hints as to why the father got tired of his marriage and took up with the girlfriend. However, the biggest unanswered question was why did the father not only kill his wife but his children as well. Is he another Susan Smith? His girlfriend says no. Since he plead guilty there is no expert testimony as to his mental health not that that would be definitive.

tt12987894,6,"Other than stitching up vignettes in a chronological order, this documentary offers barely any new insight to the Watts familicide. It has been nearly two years since his incarceration and there are no recent interviews with the killer or family members.The story plays like an episode of Air Crash Investigation (minus the investigation) - multiple failures must occur to precipitate the ultimate catastrophe. Chris stalks Shanann on Facebook. Shanann agrees to meet but would repeatedly rebuff Chris' advances. But why? Best guess would be her feelings of inadequacy about herself and her lupus. She finally succumbs to his charm and agrees to marry him. But Chris' family fails to attend his wedding because Cindy, his mother, does not approve of Shanann and does not want to lose her son to her. What does this say of Cindy? It would take a deeply narcissistic person to make her son's wedding about her and sabotage her son's happiness.According to the neighbours, Chris Watts is a subdued man. In his text messages to his wife, we see a man whose words do not reflect his actions. This is a man so accustomed to putting on a performance that he probably does not have a coherent sense of self because he has dedicated his life to appeasing everyone around him, not least his mother. According to Shanann's friends, she is ""bossy""; in other words, she is a control freak. This is consistent with her anxious and validation-seeking personality. She massively over-reacts while at her in-laws despite an already tenuous relationship with Cindy. Her text messages to her friends and husband also do not paint a portrait of someone with healthy emotional regulation. Despite all of her protestations via text messages and hand-written letters to her husband detailing her anguish, she seems incapable of having face-to-face discussions with him without flying off the handle. This was a couple in dire need of relationship counselling and the basics of effective interpersonal communication.Nothing can bring back Shanann and the kids. Just as the lessons of air crashes have made air travel safer and prevented more lives lost unnecessarily to air crashes, these tragedies hopefully serve as cautionary tales to couples in toxic or unfulfilling relationships. Get help as soon as issues arise. Most of all, do not flog a dead horse. Sometimes the best thing to do is simply to walk away calmly with dignity.",American Murder: The Family Next Door,2020-09-30,7.2,19280,2020
tt12987894,7,"American Murder: The Family Next Door is a great doc that really shows what a true monster Chris Watts was. I remember watching the same uploaded body cam footage on YouTube while this case was happening, however I would've enjoyed a more narrative story to the doc explaining key points throughout. One point being that you can clearly see how nervous Watts was being in front of police and neighbors when they were watching him put his own wife's body in his truck. If the doc had expert criminal psychologists or law enforcement who were involved with the case share their thoughts and story, would've been a nice addition to the doc and give it more insight. The ending was so gut wrenching how he described what ultimately happened to his family, crazy to think how twisted people can be in this world.",American Murder: The Family Next Door,2020-09-30,7.2,19280,2020
tt12987894,5,"This is a tragic real life story, but you can get even more evaluation and educational content from the YT documentary on this story by JCS Criminal Psychology.",American Murder: The Family Next Door,2020-09-30,7.2,19280,2020
tt12987894,5,"First off, for a documentary that's nothing but surveillance and body cam footage, it was exceptionally riveting. Unfortunately the filmmaker seemed incredibly uninterested in exploring why this tragedy happened. The simplest google search tells you this family was in financial armageddon, yet they're going on vacations, buying expensive trucks and a nice home, along with a having another kid? That seemed like important info that wasn't explored. Also this may not be for me to say but I refuse to believe that dirty girlfriend of his didn't have something to do with this. I was shocked by how disingenuous her sympathy for the family seemed along with the fact that her complaints about his lying seemed a calculated move to turn the investigators away from her. Oh and apparently she knew all about the family before she met Chris and was making phone calls to him around the time the murders happened! You know how much of this was explored in this film? Absolutely nothing. Instead you're left believing he was a normal man who just randomly killed his family when there is so many other details to this. Obviously because men are killers, right?",American Murder: The Family Next Door,2020-09-30,7.2,19280,2020
tt12987894,9,"Before I share my hot-take opinion-and that's all it is, people--let me first preface by stating the obvious:This was a tragedy. The husband is a POS, full-stop (I mean, Buddy has tribal art tattoos...that tells you everything). Violence against women is a serious issue that requires greater resources to combat. Toxic masculinity is a very real problem, for many men. This should not have happened. He should have filed for divorce, and dealt with things like a responsible adult.I hope that is clear. Please re-read, if necessary.That said, I couldn't help but cringe as the wife posted (seemingly) every detail of her/their relationship online.I know/have known many people like this-who are so caught up in their social media feedback, as they attempt to grow their brand. It gets to a point where everything is fodder for content.Again, and to be crystal clear, bring extra AF doesn't justify having violence directed towards you. But the entire time she was passive-aggressively lamenting the state of her marriage, I wondered if she considered her role in it becoming stagnant?Sadly, this will never be known, due to this SOB's actions.In any case, this was a horrible tragedy, and the documentary presents a comprehensive overview of the victim, the suspect, the crime and the investigation. Very well done, and definitely a worthwhile watch.",American Murder: The Family Next Door,2020-09-30,7.2,19280,2020
tt12987894,8,"Told really good, but really heartbreaking, don't want if you get upset.im a fully grown man that doesn't get upset but that got me going like a baby",American Murder: The Family Next Door,2020-09-30,7.2,19280,2020
tt12987894,8,"Even though I had previously watched crime shows on this tragic story, I felt this was done from a perspective in which focused on highlighting events that I either knew little or nothing about, which made for a sad but informative watch.",American Murder: The Family Next Door,2020-09-30,7.2,19280,2020
tt12987894,10,"Clips taken from the family's social media posts added something good to the documentary. It wasn't just a crime documentary following the criminal. It was made in light of the victims as it showed lots of video clips of the mom and the girls. This part was very good because it makes you remember them throughout their life, their smiles, their experiences, and not just remember them for the sad ending.
Some people will complain that you get more footage on YouTube regarding the criminal and the police part than you get on this documentary, but that's the good point. The family of the victims and the victims themselves deserved to be remembered for their life; their smiles, not just for what a criminal did to them. If you are interested in knowing more of the police details just go on YouTube.",American Murder: The Family Next Door,2020-09-30,7.2,19280,2020
tt12987894,5,"This documentary is mostly just police footage and text messages that the people involved sent to each other. It's a shame that it didn't dig a little deeper, as there are a lot of unanswered questions in this situation.I think it's pretty clear that Shanann was a very controlling and dominant person and she had a serious addiction to social media. She was obsessed with keeping her ""followers"" updated in every single aspect of their private life. I'm sure Chris hated the fact that she was so obsessed with portraying this facade of ""the perfect family"" and sharing every ounce of their private life online with a load of people, most of which they probably didn't even know.I'm not at all trying to defend Chris in any way, shape, or form, what he did was completely monstrous, I'm just confused as to why he took that path. Why kill them all?
Why not just be honest and say that the love he once felt for Shanann has faded and he wants out? I just don't get it. Because honestly, he really didn't strike me as a ""psycho killer."" Normally there is something clearly ""off"" about someone that would commit such a horrific atrocity, but not Chris, he just seemed like your average Joe.He either planned the whole thing out and knew exactly what he was going to do the moment Shanann arrived home that night, or he was just overcome by so much suppressed anger that the moment Shanann started the fight with him he finally snapped and for some reason went into full ""psycho mode.""Also, I'm surprised that Chris' mistress wasn't looked into further, as it wouldn't shock me if she acted as a conspirator in this case. Who knows, she may have even been the mastermind behind the whole thing. (I use the term ""mastermind"" very loosely of course)It's a very strange and unbelievably tragic scenario that took place. I just feel that there is so much more to this story that hasn't been brought to light.Those poor little girls, i can't imagine what they were feeling and how much fear and confusion they were experiencing that night.Why do it for God's sake?",American Murder: The Family Next Door,2020-09-30,7.2,19280,2020
tt12987894,6,"This was overall a good show for it's length. It could definitely be improved by being a short series and going more in depth, but it still exposed the deception fairly well.The reason I gave it a lower score was that it showed extremely personal communications from Shannan to her husband and friends, which her next of kin may have given consent for, but still took a lot of dignity and respect away from her IMO.I would be mortified, if after I'd been murdered, all the texts & letters discussing my sex life - in detail - were plonked on a screen for entertainment in a Netflix documentary.Things like 'I've taken a night shower, he knows that means I want sex' or 'I'm so horny today' should stay between either a couple, or the close friends one chooses to share it with, not the rest of the world.They could still have used most of the texts to demonstrate a marriage breaking down (or one person neglecting it), without using everything and leaving her some dignity.I know if it were possible, I'd be haunting the one who gave those permissions as well as the husband who murdered me and me children!",American Murder: The Family Next Door,2020-09-30,7.2,19280,2020
tt12987894,10,"This is a very intriguing and interesting case. Mainly because it is virtually impossible to understand why Chris Watts did what he did or how he thought he was going to get away with it.This film is almost redundant because of the sheer amount of information freely available on the 'net. I have gone through the whole CBI case file and transcribed the whole series of interviews just in an effort to understand what made this man tick and I'm still none the wiser. Chris Just comes across as the really nice bloke next door.Seriously wtf? This has to be one of the most stupidest, illogical and heartless crimes in history. I will never in a million years understand why he felt the need to do what he did. Never. Not only because it was just so callous but because there was no way he was getting away with it. Unless he really was that stupid.I could understand if Shan'ann was having the affair and was going to leave Chris and take the kids. I could understand that Chris might be devastated and committed murder out of despair. But that's not what happened. All he had to do was say goodbye and get a divorce.The film is ruined somewhat by the End statements highlighting how most family killers are male. I felt this unnecessary. Women also kill their children and partners. It doesn't matter if more men do it. It's not the sex that determines but their mental state. Don't witch-hunt men. Witch hunt psychopaths.",American Murder: The Family Next Door,2020-09-30,7.2,19280,2020
tt12987894,9,"This dude is pure evil, I tell you what. Tried to lie to the media, his families and friends, but man, THAT NEIGHBOR, he already knew. He knew right away, GOD BLESS THE NEIGHBOR.9/10",American Murder: The Family Next Door,2020-09-30,7.2,19280,2020
tt12987894,9,"Usually I absolutely despise spoilers, but 'American Murder: The Family Next Door' is actually one time I would recommend knowing the final result of before going in. I had this spoiled for me before watching and ultimately actually ended up being happy that it happened. The reason for this is that the most fascinating part of this documentary was watching the killer's movements throughout the runtime. Watching how they acted knowing full well what they'd done. It's one thing to watch a guilty character in a movie move about, but a whole other watching a real life person do it.This documentary was captivating from start to finish. It's unlike any documentary I've seen before in the sense that it contains zero current interviews. All the footage is from police body-cams, surveillance footage, interview room footage and Facebook footage. It almost feels like a real movie in that sense. I understand why not many documentaries are lucky enough to have this much footage available to them, but if they do they should absolutely always use it.This is a heart-breaking story. The details of the crime are absolutely devastating. It's not an easy watch. It is proof that pure evil does exist in this world sadly. It is a very well-made documentary though and well worth your time to watch it. I highly recommend this one.",American Murder: The Family Next Door,2020-09-30,7.2,19280,2020
