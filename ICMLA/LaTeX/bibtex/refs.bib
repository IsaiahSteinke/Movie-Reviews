BibTeX database for the ICMLA 2021 manuscript
Author: Isaiah Steinke
Last revised: May 23, 2023

Entries are alphabetized by the last name of the first author or name of website or organization.

**Need to retain "\&" in BiBTeX fields to avoid errors during compilation. Note that the temporary *.bbl file will likely need to be deleted before recompiling if it is necessary to change "&" to "\&" in any of the entries.
